<h2>About</h2>

<p>
Yo. I'm Liz. I'm a Goblin, Part-Time Shark, VTuber, retired speedrunner, author, GDQ staff, Sega fan, "Yuri Sommelier", Walking Encyclopedia of All Things Useless, Twitch partner, and general menace. I say "Murr" a lot.
</p>

<p>
Just a lady who plays obscure, weird, or bad games a lot. Nothin' fancy! I'm here to cause problems and play hot garbage. I am the least professional person on the internet. This is not a place of honor, views my own, etc.
