Warptank is mayb ethe MOST like an NES game to me. It feels EXTREMELY like an NES game you'd play from like 1987. For 1985 it feels really ahead of its time, but it's a damn good game.

In Warptank, you must save the world from the evils of Big Tank. You do this by going into the different parts of a space station, and sever its ties to "Capsule World". There are several different levels you can go into from a big central connecting map. It's not a complex setup, though it's actually SHOCKINGLY big. This game is WAY larger than I expected. There are over 25 levels. That is a lot of god damn levels.

You play as a little tank. The warp tank! You move along, and can press B to shoot and A to warp between the ceiling and the floor. If you warp successfully (the floor is actually there, or nothing is in the way), you'll appear on the ceiling. So you've got to move along, dealing with enemies and hazards as you find a way to proceed, using slopes to move between floor/ceiling and wall/wall. It's a good puzzly action... platformer, kind of? It's EXTREMELY creative and enjoyable.

In each level there's also, what else, COFFEE to collect! Collect them all for a bonus level. It's very similar to Campanella in that regard, the coffee is in little hidden nooks.

The music and aesthetics are on point, though after my friend told me "the music can be sung to the cadence of the Mr. Bucket jingle", it was COMPLETELY RUINED for me. 100% fucking ruined. Still good, though.

This game is long, and can be a little challenging at points, but it's never unfair with unlimited lives and constant forward movement. One of the best games in the pack.
