Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you're curious about a nerd's views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I've watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!

STARTING ENTERPRISE NOW! I know NOTHING about this, other than it takes place very early in the timeline, has a guy named ARcher and a guy named Phlox, people smother gel on each other naked a lot, and a lot of people get a lot of opinions.



**Broken Bow** - SNW
6.5/10

We start with a kid being racist towards Vulcans, complaining that if the Vulcans were actually helping them, they'd be going at Warp 5 by now. We then jump cut 30 years later, and it's now the opening of Star Trek. Some aliens drop down, a Klingon blows them up, and then a farmer blows him away with a blaster shotgun.

Then we get the opening theme song. If you were wondering, this is was my watch club's reaction to it:

So apparently the plan for Enterprise was that Voyager's rating were falling by the end, so they're trying to make a new kind of Star Trek. Something Modern. By modern, we mean dated as fuck, and kind of boring, I guess? Also the CGI is very, VERY dated too.

Anyways, the Vulcans are here. The Klingons are upset a Klingon got shot. He's still alive, but the Vulcans are ready to just kill him. Their logic is nonsense. Then we're introducd to our 'hero'.

Captain Archer's ship is ready to be launched, but the Vulcans are like "Don't launch yet and go out and meet other people in space, you're not ready". They're all kind of dicks about it. Whoever wrote this doesn't know how to write Vulcans. A Vulcan woman tries telling him to wait until he's ready, and he threatens to beat her. Captain "Would beat a woman" Archer. The Earth Admiral is like "alright fuck these guys, we're launching after all".

We then get scenes of all the crew. It's kinda hard to tell who is and is not important in these scnees, but I'll try and explain them all. We've got Archer, he's kinda smug and I'm not sure how much I like him so far. Then Phlox, the doctor working on the Klingon who seems like a friendly guy, Reed, the Armory Officer. I can't tell what his deal is. Mayweather, the resident Black Guy. We'll see how he is. So far he seems young and friendly. He's also really horny for aliens. Sato, a Linguist who's really excited to learn Klingon, she's kinda cool so far. Tucker, the Engineer, who's kinda belligerent and rude. He yells a lot. I cannot tell Tucker or Reed apart.

And then we meet T'Pol.

She's assigned to the ship, the Enterprise, by their Vulcan superiors. No one is happy about this. When she entered in, I was like "is Archer gonna be racist in this?" and then he opened his fucking mouth, and yes, he is. AND Sexist! I think the idea is that he's annoyed at the Vulcans cause of history and personal things, and the idea is that we'll eventually grow as people and our cultures and civilizations will grow closer. That's the idea. But it's not pleasant to watch the start of that!!

We also get a scene where an alien talks to the Emperor from Star Wars about the Klingon being takne by the Humans. This guy's alien species then comes and steals the Klingon away. The alien's species is the... Suliban. Which is inspired by the Taliban. Yeah. *sigh*. The Suliban is genetically enhanced, which is strange for their species. T'Pol tries to tell them to go back home. She's told to shut up. They go to the last known place the Klingon, Klaang, was known to be. A planet called Rigel. Everyone is pretty much immediately kidnapped. T'Pol gives a "told you so" look. Alright.
