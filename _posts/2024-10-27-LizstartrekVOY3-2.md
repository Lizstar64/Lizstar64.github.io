Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you're curious about a nerd's views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I've watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!


**Future's End II** - VOY
4/10

<img src="https://imgur.com/P5ZqPsw.png" alt="trek">

Aaand we're back. Tuvok is getting some burritos, hes a big fan of tex mex. I guess the whole "the Voyager appeared in the sky aand everyone saw it" thing isn't really important, okay. They hand wave it with a "people think it's faked". Sure, I guess.

Okay, the more I watch this villain, the less I like him. He legit feels like a fucking mary sue in a fanfic. Oh, he had holo-emitters set up in his office, of course. Also he already reverse engineered a holo-emitter device that allows the doctor to move around freely. And he can use an apple PC to outsmart Voyager. Yes he's using 500 year technology on them but that's not how technology works, and that's not how this works at all. If you give a computer to a dude from the 1100s he would be able to use it to defeat a conquistador, is what I'm saying. This ENTIRE concept is completely out the window, none of them are selling it, and since it's the entire basis of the episode, it makes it less and less likable the more they push it.

They warp Elon Musk up, which they should have done ages ago, with Sarah Silverman helping them out now. But of COURSE Elon Musk has a fucking machine that makes it so he can disrupt transport, which seems like a BAD idea, but also he's a fucking dumbass. It DOES make Chakotay and Torres crashland in Arizona though, where they're found by anti-government farmers who capture them, accuse them of beign spies, and threaten them with SPAS shotguns. Where the mother fuck did these people get military grade weapons? Also they keep insulting Chakotay because he's a native. I hate this episode, I think. I think they're implied to be WACO? JFC.

Elon Musk is trying to go to the future so he can steal more technology and sell it. It's "for the betterment of mankind". Eat my ass. Anyways he escapes, there's some chase scenes, they also get Chakotay and Torres out. And when Elon Musk tries to fly in the future, they just blow him up with a sneaky photon torpedo. Then Braxton shows back up and takes them to the future. This episode made the first part worse by comparison. All the worst parts of the first episode are the parts this episode focused on. I'll just pretend the Doctor can walk around freely now cause they bought it from a merchant or something.

This episode was originally planned to be a FOUR PARTER. Thank the fucking lord. Also, they wanted to bring Silverman on as a main character. That would have been SO GOOD, and made the episode at least okay. But no. Apparently Berman heard their offers and went "Absolutely not >:(" Cause MORE WOMS ON MY SHOW? ABSOLUTELY NOT. Fuck Berman.


**Warlords** - VOY
6/10

<img src="https://imgur.com/65RG1O3.png" alt="trek"

Our episode starts with Neelix in the holodeck getting a foot massage, which seems like it might be a sex thing for them? Foomox.

Anyway this episode has nothing to do with that. They rescue three people from an exploding ship, though one of them dies as Kes is working on him. Kes immediately starts acting kinda weird, and breaks up with Neelix in an awkward scene, and then when they go to drop them off, she and the two survivors hijack a shuttle and fly down. Turns out that the guy who died, Tieran, is a mind jacking virus basically, who swaps bodies when he host dies. 200 years ago he was the ruler of this world, and he's been working on starting a rebellion to place himself back where he belongs. So now Kes is an evil psychotic bitch, and is very, very sexy.

<img src="https://imgur.com/2ZdV98s.png" alt="trek"

She also seduces the 2nd son of the Autarch, after murdering his father right in front of him. So like, Tieran is a man. He was a man in life, he's still assumedly a guy at heart. But I guess for a mind swapping virus, gender means little. But like, still a guy. And here he is, seducing a guy. This is one of the gayest things ever seen in Star Trek.

Tieran stays in Kes's body because she has psychic powers and he can use it to kill and coerce people. Kes being evil is very hot, btw. Have I mentioned that? This episode is a lot less interesting for its actual plot and more for the weird kinkiness of all of it.

They try rescuing her, sending Tuvok on a solo mission. Tuvok is caught. They plan more things, but it seems like they may not need to. Kes is starting to win out in a mental battle, there's a big "fight inside the mind" scene, I love those.

<img src="https://imgur.com/EEHyF2K.png" alt="trek"

Eventually, Tieran focusing on the battle within and becoming unstable makes his empire crumble around him. His fortress is stormed, and the Voyager crew go and take him out using a medical thingy the doctor made, wiping him out first from Kes, then from a person he tried to jump to again. The episode ends with Kes having severe PTSD about all the people who died cause of her hands. Also, she and Neelix just aren't together anymore. Even though Tieran is the reason they broke up, she had no control. It's never really explained, and there's no conclusion. That's weird.


**The Q and the Grey** - VOY
3/10

<img src="https://imgur.com/vTrO6uc.png" alt="trek"

Q shows up and asks Janeway to fuck him. Hey, remember when we saw Q last time? In that episode, he was a sexist pig who treated Janeway like shit. Now he's like "you're so hot, fuck me". This is EXACTLY how I expect weird sexist assholes acting. Hating on women but god damn they wanna get in that pussy. Anyways, he's really, REALLY pushy, and I kind of hate it. He's like "oh I've been lonely, havign dated anyone for a billion years". I guess Vash is nothing. 

<img src="https://imgur.com/zYvKjSh.png" alt="trek"

Hey, a female Q! She's apparently basically married to our Q. She's also played by Key'lar, the half Klingon who fucked Worf, and one of the hottest people in Star Trek. She's a haughty bitch who hates everything here.

Anyways Q teleports Janeway to a civil war representation and explains to her that he started a war in the continuum, based on Quinn's teaching, the Q that killed himself earlier in Voyager. So now he needs Janeway's help, because he thinks if they make a new species with a half Q and Human, it'd end the war. I don't see it, but I dunno. He also talk about how this has never been done, Q are beyond sex, no Q has ever done it. Uh, you rememebr that TNG episode with the Q that had a kid who didn't know she was a Q? Cause the writers did not!

Anyways, this war is causing stars to go supernova, so it's actually VERY bad. The female Q is stuck in subspace, without her powers for some reason, and she works with the crew to sneak through a supernova, while Q and Janeway are in the Continuum, represented by the American Civil War. They try to get a cease fire, and the traditionalist Q are like "Nope. Time to kill you both :)" and are only stopped cause the Voyager crew somehow show up loaded up to the gills with the Q's own weapons, somehow. Q and Q fuck, which makes this the first time completely uncensored sex was shown on screen, and Q has a baby. I still don't get this plan, but it works, I guess. No more explosions.

This episode kinda blows.



**Macrocosm** - VOY
9/10

<img src="https://imgur.com/RUDGoWy.png" alt="trek"

Janeway and Neelix are returning to Voyager after a chat with some new aliens that Janeway pissed off. They scan the ship to find it's floating dead in space, and some interference is making it so they can't scan for life signs. They wander around, trying to find out what happened, but find no one, like the crew just disappeared in the middle of what they were doing. Systems are failing all over the ship, including environmental controls. And they find signs of Goop burning holes in the hull. Yep.

We're doing an Alien.

Neelix gets gooped and feels sick. Janeway leaves him to grab a medkit, and he screams, disappearing shortly after. Now it's just Janeway, a missing crew, and an unknown alien. What does she do? That's right.

Go full Ripley.

<img src="https://imgur.com/JD9myCp.png" alt="trek"

This is legit one of the best fucking things, already.

The episode now becomes Alien meets Die Hard. It's actuallty badass. She sneaks around, sending out an SOS. Meanwhile, some weird bugs are floating around, and they sting Janeway. Uh oh. She continues to go around, and finds the crew all piled up, alive, but barely, sick with something.

<img src="https://imgur.com/3EXS5z0.png" alt="trek"

Janeway blows away a buzzing alien whatever it is, and then makes it to Medbay, where the Doctor is, of course, still alive. Thankfully he hasn't shut down yet. He tells a story about how they were called to help some miners on a nearby planet suffering from an outbreak. When he beams back, they accidentally spread the virus, and it gets out of hand. The Doctor can't explore, because his holo emitter gives off infrared, which the viruses use to track their victims.

The Doctor and Janeway work together to release the cure onto the ship, as the aliens from the start come to "purify" them, cause the only cure is to blow them the fuck up :) Janeway convinces them to hold off for an hour, as she tricks the viruses into the holodeck in a very funny scene, and then fucking bombs it with a grenade.

Good episode, big fan. And not JUST cause Kate Mulgrew is hot as fuck.



**Fair Trade** - VOY
7/10

<img src="https://imgur.com/TTAsYI3.png" alt="trek"

Neelix is acting weird. He's trying to get In with all the people on the ship, trying to get more jobs on, and he's kinda just getting in the way. I wonder what that's about. Meanwhile, they come across The Nekrit Expanse, a vast uncharted section of space. To go in prepared, they go to a local trading depot. The person who owns it takes 20% of all deals and is a grumpy guy, but he's fair, and willing to help Voyagert get supplies. While on the station, Neelix finds an old friend, Wix, who he parted on bad terms with. Apparently Wix basically took a bullet for him years ago. Neelix feels awful and wants to help his old friend, who tyells him to not worry about it. Seems HIS life is going better, but Neelix explains how worried he is. He's never been past the Nekrit Expanse. His job, as a guide, will soon be moot. So that's why he's trying to get more jobs. It's understandable. He wants to stay on board.

Things get a biiiit worse. Wix wants Neelix's help (using Voyager's tech) to help him covertly secure a deal. Yep, it's drug. He's smuggling drugs. And after Neelix has to defend himself, with a phaser, he's now implicated in all this, as they realize that the phaser was from Voyager, and are searching for either someone on the crew smuggling drugs, or someone who stole a phaser.

Neelix is now caught in a hard place. He has a friend, who he feels indebted to, and also the crew he's a part of. It's a bunch of awkward situations. Especialyl as the episode devolves with Neelix asking the crew about their histories, and what they'd do in a situation like his, basically. And all the guilt weighing on him. It's not at all bad, in any way, but I don't personally like it. Those kinda things just get to me and make me very upset.

<img src="https://imgur.com/FYNeT99.png" alt="trek"

He has to steal some warp plasma to pay off the drug dealers. I guess they're gonna like, snort it? Warp Plasma Challenge, let's gooooo. But he doesn't do it. He can't. I mean, he asks what did Paris in, and Paris responds with "I think my biggest downfall was I didn't tell the truth". Like, how can you fight that? That was set up way too well. It's like they all KNOW Neelix is actually doing it.

Neelix and Wix manage to confess, but strike a deal, turning in the drug dealers in exchange for them not being charged. 

<img src="https://imgur.com/QzZWEU3.png" alt="trek"

Some REALLY good alien designs in this episode. Anyways, Neelix outsmarts the drug dealers with a clever venting plasma scheme.  The episode ends with Janeway giving Neelix a "I am very disappointed in you, but we are family. We'll get through this" speech. It's a good Janeway moment. And now Neelix's job as guide is done, and we'll move on. This is good, in a way. One of the issues with the first two seasons was the feeling we kinda weren't going anywhere.

This episode was fine. It did have "very special episode" energy, but not nearly as bad as that one TNG episode.
