I've already talked about this one before, but hey, I mastered the set, so time to talk about it again.

This is a game set that I myself made! The RAM for this game is fucked, as the RAM for a lot of the sets I try to dev are.

Dharma Doujo is a SNES game made by Metro, based on their Arcade puzzler. It's a very unique puzzler unlike anything I've played, except its spiritual sequel made by the same people, and a bootleg of it called Mang-chi. But other than THAT, it is very unique. You've got a stack of blocks, and you can hit anywhere on this stack vertically, grabbing the furthest left block. If you get all of the same block, it's cleared. Otherwise, the blocks you grabbed will slide back up into the stack. Organize your grabs to clear all blocks and beat the stage, before the yokai climbs all the way to the top!

It's a hard as hell game, mostly based on it being unlike anything you've ever played. You gotta basically learn a new language with this game. And it gets HECTIC. If you're playing as the monk in this, the yokai is time based, but if you're the shrine maiden, you can take your time, the yokai will only climb with misses. This can be good for learning the game, though there's a lot to be said for lighting a fire under your ass.

You've also got two unique modes for this game, which aren't in the arcade! You've got Endless Mode, where a Tengu will knock blocks down periodically. He'll show up when there are only two matches left to make, or if you take a long-ass time. It's really kinda easy, at least it is to me, as I'm really good at this game. Maybe for noobs he's hard as hell, who knows. The harder difficulties make it so that some junk blocks show up too, it's not all clearable, which is fascinating.

There's also a multiplayer mode, which is fantastic, but I didn't have to do for the set

The other unique mode is Puzzle Mode, where a judge shows you a finished stack, and you have a stack on the left. Organize it in a way to mimic the stack on the right. This is very, VERY hard to me. My brain just boggles at this, and it gets really, REALLY complex by the end. It takes genius level brainpower. 50 levels, and a challenge for sure jsut after the first 10.

Over all, I do prefer the arcade version, but that's just cause of the mild graphical changes. This version IS prolly much better, all things considered. And as a game is very, VERY worth your time.
