Amazing Penguin is one of those Gameboy games that I feel left zero impact. No one remembers this game, and no one goes out of their way to play it, but it's there, and it's certainly not bad. Some people prolly had it as a kid or rented it, and think rather positively of it. But it'll always be a like, low B or C tier Gameboy game. Just another part of the collection, never a standout.

Amazing Penguin is a Maze Chase game, rather similar to something like Pepper II for arcades. You play as a Penguin moving through an area made up of lines. There's orbs on those lines, and if you pick up all the orbs surrounding a square/filled in area between the lines, it'll clear and become an image. You can also kick the orbs. Black orbs are just pickups that can be kicked, and the negative orbs make enemies swap direction. Enemies move around entirely in a clockwise/counter clockwise motion, and don't chase you at all, which can be used to try and dodge/read their movements. Of course, there's usually a LOT of enemies.

Later levels in this game get pretty hard. One path through, and lots of enemies. But it's still a simple and cute little game, only about an hour or two in length if you sit down and power through it.
