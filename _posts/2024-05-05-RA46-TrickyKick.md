More TG-16 games! This one is Tricky Kick, took me about 6 or so hours to fully master. I actually own this game! Or well, my boyfriend does, but his collection is mine~ muahaha. What a weird cover art lmao

The game is a very simple puzzle game, and I know I've played other games like it, but I can't remember what they're called. You walk around a space, and there are blocks. You kick blocks, and if two blocks of the same type collide, they explode. Explode all the blocks to win. You can kick a block through another block, causing the further one to go flying, but can't make blocks collide by doing this, if they're both in a corner.

There are 60 levels (kinda), 10 levels for 6 different worlds. Each 10 levels are its own contained mini story, and they're cute little stories with their own block types and tileset. Like, a fantasy forest for an elf saving his fairy friend from an evil sorceress, a Japanese girl seeing yankees and businessmen on her way to a crush's birthday, a young boy exploring a mansion of scary monsters. Nothing here is mind breaking, but it's cute.

Once you beat the 60 levels, that's it, gg. But there's a SPECIAL mode, unlocked by putting in the password MILKYWAY. You get 60 more puzzles, and these are REAL tough. The game's a good brain tingler, and I got stuck quite a few times.

7/10! Worth checking out, if you like puzzle games like this.
