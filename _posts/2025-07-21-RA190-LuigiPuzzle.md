Homebrew is a bit of a mixed bag. You've got some of the best games I've ever played as homebrew, games that make the console they're on sing and make you wish "God, I wish this had come out back in the day it would have changed my life". Then you have games like this, which you wonder if it was just a half finished practice project.

I'm not shitting on Luigi Puzzle because it's a sliding puzzle game. A lot of people hate those, I've gotten a bregrudging respect for them after mastering Wind Waker. No, I'm shitting on it because it's one of the worst sliding puzzle games I've played. No music at all, just puzzle. You've got Luigi over there thinking about the finished puzzle and lookin'... really suspect. And then you've got the puzzle itself.

My #1 issue with this game is that the puzzles are literally impossible. Whatever random generation algorithm they used to make these puzzles, they messed up, and the puzzles are unsolvable. Only one worked for me, and that was Donkey Kong. As a result, the set requires you to only solve puzzles up to 90%, but wow. That's really annoying. What's the #1 most important part of a puzzle game? Uh, being able to fucking solve it?

I don't wanna be mean to the dev, who prolly made this as a side project in 2006 testing GBA tech. That's a really early homebrew. But I dunno, man. You coulda put in some kind of algorithm to test the solvability of puzzles??
