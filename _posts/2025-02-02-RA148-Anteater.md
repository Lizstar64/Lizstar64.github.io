I already did a review on Anteater a while ago, for my "Games You May Not Have Heard Of" series. It's an absolutely amazing maze game with almost perfect design, and while quite challenging, has a lot of room for fun fast paced strategizing of how you're going to get that last egg.

I made this set, and people seem to like it, which is good. It came out on the 17th, like, a couple weeks ago, and already has more players than my other sets I've made.... except Pyramid, which has the most for some god forsaken reason.

If you're interested in learning more about Anteater, including the skullduggery of the early PC market where they just stole games all the time, maybe look up my review of it. But either way, you should play Anteater. It's very good.
