This is another set that I personally made, which also means it's a set of a game I really care about, and have also already reviewed for my obscure games series I did. So I don't need to go over it again. But there's a few things I can add! I had to do a BIG deep dive into Deppy to figure stuff out about it. It has a lot of hidden stuff in it I never really tackled until making this set. BTW this set's RAM is fucked. This was an AGONIZING experience to code for.

So, Tryrush Deppy is a platformer where you play as a cute taxi cab racing across America. The thing about Deppy is that it has a lot of hidden stuff to find in each level, but the game doesn't make it very easy or rewarding to explore a level. Usually when I play, I just try and play fast and clean to get through each level. But there are three collectables: Dramas, Stars, and Extra Stages. Each level has a Drama, some specific levels have Dramas, and each world has an Extra Stage. Stars are special mini stages where you need to get through a small puzzle room cleanly while getting all the purple stars in them. Dramas are saving different characters in a level, which can also change future level layouts and stuff. And finally, extra stages are bullshit.

Extra stages are hidden fake walls you can jump into by pressing up. These are USUALLY in like, billboards and things, but there's no indication you can do this. You then get an extra bonus stage to run through, with weird-ass dog cars that bark and bite at you, and usually a mini gimmick. And if you clear the stage, nothing happens. Instead, you need to find the fake wall in the middle of the fucking level, break it, and then destroy the enemy that pops out.

Getting different combinations of collectables gives you different endings. No one knows how to get one of the endings, namely this one with the weird omake cutscenes by the author. Once you beat the game with all the extra modes, you ALSO get a time attack mode with the extra stages, getting through them as fast as possible. The times on that are SHOCKINGLY tight. It's pretty damn hard.

Anyways, good game, but kinda frustrating and janky. Not super fun to 100% though. It's NOT designed for it. The game has ratchet camera, so you can't go backwards to explore, you need to INTENTIONALLY die in order to get 100% of the items on one playthrough. Which I did not make an achievement, mind you. But I wanted to do it anyway, and it was annoying. There's also no documentation online about this game or where shit is, so it's annoying to explore. Good game, but just play it casually. Don't speedrun it, and don't 100% it.
