The long awaited sequel to Mortol 2 is here! And while Chun came up with the original idea, it was kind of changed to make the game more fun and pleasant. But now HE'S in control, that ol fuddy duddy Smolski is gone, so now Chun can do whatever he wants. And he wants to go back to his original idea, with MORTOL II!

The government is bringing back the evil to gain more power. Wow, how unrealistic. The people, upset that their sacrifice was forgotten, stand up once more to save Mortolia. This time, you have 100 lives. And no way to gain them. It's a much differently designed game, but that original idea is there, and while it is kind of anxiety inducing to watch your lives drain away, the game isn't too long once you know what to do.

The correct play is to explore, not give a shit about your lives, then route out a path after you know what you even need to do. It's one giant open map, which changes as you effect it. Enemies stay dead, your sacrifices stay there, allowing you to tame this wilderness. You've got 5 different units: The warrior, who has strong melee strikes and can turn into stone platforms like in the first game, the Gunner who has long range guns and can spawn an ammo pack, the Scout who can double jump, throw a few ninja stars, and can create a teleporter, the Engineer who throws arced wrenches and can build 5-tall pipes through the ground, very useful if you know how to use her, and the Bomber, who is TOTALLY not a girl in a kink outfit, who explodes. That's what she does. She explodes.

Using these fives units, you must explore Nilpis (which is VERY fun to say) and tame it, reaching into the castle to defeat the ancient evil inside. Feeling your lives drain away is painful and anxiety inducing, but I managed to do it with 52 lives left... the cherry is to do it in under 50, for the record, so I was VERY close. But my route got me there.

Each of the units has their own music, and the vibe and aesthetics are dark and spooky and weird, in the same way Mortol 1 is. It's a good weird time that is just as good, if not possibly even better, than Mortol 1.
