I was hanging with a friend and for SOME DAMN REASON I decided this is the game we should play. I don't know why I thought that was a good idea. This is Fisher Price: I Can Remember, an obscure NES game, licensed by Nintendo, with that Nintendo seal of quality, and it's an "educational" game. It's not. There's no educational value at ALL in this, as there probably couldn't be on the NES for a game for 2-3 year olds. This game is, instead, fucking product placement advertising, in a way that kind of pisses me off.

The "game" is simple. You flip over spots to reveal all the WONDERFUL FISHER-PRICE TOYS YOU SHOULD ANNOY YOUR PARENTS TO BUY YOU, and then if you match the same one, you get a point! Pretty hard, huh? There's a point system that's nonsense, it's VERY slow paced and boring, and there's like 5 rounds of this. You can play VS others, or with a computer. And that's it. I thought this would be goofy and fun but it kinda just annoyed me in the end.
