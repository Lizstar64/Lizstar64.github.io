I don't know if this is so much a thing anymore, but when I was a kid, computers were JUST starting to become bigger and bigger, and used for things that weren't like, landing shit on the moon. And that included in schools. My media center was getting new computers, and they were trying to find ways to use computers for education. One of those ways was for testing. I remember one of the first times I really used the computer at my school for things that weren't like, teaching how to type or playing games, was a book test. I don't know if they still do that anymore, but that's all this program is. It's a test on a book that you'd teach in schools.

I have never read Bridge to Terabithia. Not once. I knew absolutely nothing about it going in, except that I'd heard the name before. It's a popular book from like, the 60s or 70s that they taught in schools, never taught it to me though. Anyways, the test is several parts, very simple, ranging from answering basic plot questions to putting events in order.

Like I said, I've never read this book, but I managed to do very well on the test. Why, am I psychic? Well, I DID go to school for literature. I know how books work. And this is a basic test for babies on a simple kids book. It appears to be a fucking DARK kids book, like, wow. But it's still for younger audiences. So I know how basic story structure works, and I used context clues and judgement to guess how the story went, and y'know what, I got it right, pretty much every time. And even if I missed a question I could just redo the test, cause what was stoppign me?

This is a weird review, cause like, it's not a game. It's not a game at ALL. It's barely even educational, it's just a test, it doesn't teach anything, it tests you on what you've been taught elsewhere. But this was a thing back then, and this was how I first interracted with computers, so it's important to me for that.
