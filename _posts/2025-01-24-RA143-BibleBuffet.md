I've talked about Wisdom Tree before, but as a quick summary, they were a bootleg NES developer who made a bunch of subpar NES games back in the day, unlicensed by Nintendo. Nintendo told stores that they wouldn't give them any stock if they sold unlicensed games, so Wisdom Tree, at that point called Color Dreams, were pushed out of the market. But they came up with a genius idea. Christian Stores had their own ecosystem. They didn't care about Nintendo refusing to sell them stock, because they didn't buy any of it anyway. So let's just make Christian games instead. It's a corporate and kind of depressing reason to sell out to mainstream Christianity, but it worked rather well. Color Dreams is STILL technically in business, running off this energy, and also the infamy of their games, cause they're not too good.

Bible Buffet is one of their games, maybe one of their best, but certainly one of their most "why does this exist". It's a complete rip-off of Candy Land. Most Wisdom Tree games are uncreative recyclings of other concepts from other games, like most unlicensed developers, but this is pretty blatant. You spin the wheel and go down spaces on this board. Sometimes, you land on a bible question, but this game actually has NOTHING bible about it at all. No questions are written, and there's no references to the bible anywhere. Instead, it's all in the manuals. At the start, you put in a number for the selection of questions, like 101 for Jesus Questions, 105 for women in the bible, etc. Then the game says "answer question #8", with a multiple choice, you answer it from your quiz book, and then it grades you. You get nothing for getting them right, except the game goes "this person got the most questions right" at the end. Fun.

When you land on a space, you enter a top down action style game. You shoot spoons, knives, or forks, at food themed enemies and try and leave the level. You can drop exploding barrels, and pick up a few power ups and items for these stages. If you die it skips your turn and you have to try again. It's... okay. But kinda uninteresting. Also, there's food to pick up, and it increases your lbs at the end, and the game also counts who got the most lbs.

Bible Buffet is technically an okay game but it's not very interesting, once you get past its weird as fuck premise. A bible game that has nothing to do with the bible, with a bunch of food themed stuff to it. Okay. Weird.
