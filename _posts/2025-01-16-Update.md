I seriously have no idea why that is. I think imgur updated a thing and broke literally everything which is very, VERY annoying, because I have 260 fucking pages here FILLED with dozens upon dozens of images. I really, REALLY hope they fix it soon...

I know not a lot of people read this but it's still something that brings me joy, so like, I wanna hold onto it. It's also kind of the only part of Cohost I still got left.
