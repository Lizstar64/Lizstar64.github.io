So last year, I beat Final Fantasy V for the first time. It's one of my absolute favorite Final Fantasies, and I adored it. After I was done, I started having a desire to go back and play it again... but I knew I should wait. Because every year in June, an event goes on called Four Job Fiesta, and I'd want to get in on that.

See, in FF5, you unlock new classes, called Jobs, and you can swap your characters between these. The FJF is a kind of challenge run. You go on the website, and any time you unlock knew jobs, you roll to decide which of those you can use. Once you unlock 4 jobs, that's it, those are all you can use. Those four.

There are a lot of modes of play, though for the RA set, I had to do three different kinds. Yes. Three different playthroughs of Final Fantasy 5, which I did, one after another, in a few days. And yes, I still kinda wanna play this game, writing this two months after. It's just a really good game, okay?

FJF turns Final Fantasy 5 from an RPG with a lot of tactical choices to a puzzle game. How can I tackle this obstacle with the tools I have available to me? Every job combo has the capacity to beat the game, it's been tested. But you have to do some WILD tactics and strategies, especially if you get Berserker. Or god forbid you're playing on a mode that allows doubles and you get MULTIPLE berserkers.

I played three different styles. I played Regular, Onion, and Meteor. In Regular, any time you get a new crystal, you roll for jobs from that crystal. So for example, the first crystal, Wind, gives you White Mage, Black Mage, Thief, Blue Mage, Knight, and Monk. You can ONLY use that job, so for the first little while, you have four of one class. For example, my first run, I got monk. So I had four monks until the next crystal, then I got any combination of Monk and Mystic Knight, but I HAD to use at least one of each class I have. So I could use three Mystic Knights and 1 Monk.

The second style I played was Onion. This uses only jobs from Final Fantasy 3. And then finally, Meteor, where you can get ANY job at any point. So even with those wind crystal jobs, you could get like, Chemist, and have to just use Freelancer until you get to the next crystal. This DID happen to me, though luckily I got Summoner so that I only had to Freelance up through the Water Tower.

If you know anything about FJF, you're looking at those classes I rolled for my three runs, and going "Holy SHIT. Your luck was incredible". And it was! A Mystic Knight/Bard run, ANOTHER Bard run but also white White Mage and Black Mage, and finally a Chemist/Time Mage/Summoner run? Omega stood no chance.

The thing with FF5 is that a lot of jobs are broken as fuck. Just, in different ways. And you need to know a little about each of them to understand that. Like for example, Time Mage has access to a spell called Quick, which allows you to immediately do two more turns. However, due to a bug, poison damage still procs, so if you poison, then quick, you can sit there doing nothing for 20 minutes until Omega dies. I did that one for my last run~

The goal is to beat ExDeath and the two bonus bosses, Shinryu and Omega. Those last two are tough, trust me.

Each of these runs took me like.... 10-20 hours? So it was a LOT of FF5 in one week. But I'm already looking forward to next year, I think this will become a thing for me~ Though I might only do one run each year, going forward. RA edits this achievement set to add in a new ruleset every year, so I'll probably do whatever that is when the time comes~
