On a whim, I decided to play this. This is a Game Gear homebrew Solitaire game based on Shenzhen I/O, a Zachtronics game. If you don't know, Zachtronics is known for their Solitaire variants. And this is one of them, just ported to the Game Gear.

It's a little confusing at first, considering it's an entirely new variant of Solitaire with all new cards, but once you understand it, it's honestly a pretty easy variant. You've got three kinds of cards. Number cards, which you need to get into the top right three slots. They stack like usual number cards in Solitaire do, and must be stacked in increasing value from 1. Normal stuff. Then you have the Dragon Cards. Claws, paws, and hoofs. These are put in the top left three slots. They  can't be placed on any other card in the main playing area. And then the snep card, which is a flower in the original. It's a "free" card that can be put in the top middle slot. Aaaand that's it.

The game can't have the entire play field on the screen at once, so you gotta scroll left and right. But that's it. It's solitaire. Simple and easy. Zachtronics makes good solitaire variants, check them out.
