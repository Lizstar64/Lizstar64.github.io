This is Blazing Dragons, a point and click adventure developed by Illusions Gaming Company, who mostly made point and click games you might vaguely remember based on prior properties like the Genesis Scooby Doo game, or the windows Beevis and Butthead games. It was published by Crystal Dynamics, who actually still exists, and is pretty well known for Tomb Raider. Not so much this game. This is one of the more obscure games in their repitoire, another point and click adventure game based on a prior property. This time, it's based on the TV show Blazing Dragons... kind of.

Blazing Dragons was a late 90s British cartoon made Terry Jones, of Monty Python fame. My THEORY is that this game was something entirely different, and then they connected it to the cartoon because they had Terry Jones on the project. It has some of the same characters, but the designs are COMPLETELY different and a lot of the characters are changed or missing. The most interesting change is the different designs. In the cartoon, they're very bipedal dragons, typical cartoony dragon design. In the game, they're all taurs, which is VERY interesting. I kinda like taurs. I just think they're neat.

In the game, you play as Flicker, who starts the game as the royal inventor, I think. He's a smartypants kinda socially unaware dork, but he has a romance thing with the princess of the realm, Princess Flame. Unfortunately, she's set to be wed to the winner of the Knight Tournament, and Flicker isn't a knight, much to her chagrin. So the goal of the game is to become a knight by helping the Knights of the Square table, as bumbling as they are. At the same time, the kingdom's sworn enemy, King Geoffry the Human, is trying to take over the land with the help of his wizard Merl. They also have an evil dragon on the inside, the king's advisor, who is not in the show. So you've gotta stop that too. Simple enough premise, right?

The game is a rather traditional point and click of the time. You've got a cursor that changes actions, things like look, talk, grab, use. You wander around, interract with people, solve puzzles, and collect a bunch of items that you rub on other items. The game is, for the MOST part, filled with good puzzles, but there are a couple that completely confounded me with their leaps of logic. But, in clal, it was actually a rather well crafted game, puzzle wise.

The big thing about the game is its writing and star cast, though. First of all, the cast is wild. Terry Kones, Cheech Marin, Jim Cummings, Rob Paulsen, Jess Harnel, it's an all star cast, and they all do a good job. There's ONE problem I'll talk about later with the voice acting, though. The other thing is its writing. It's very, VERY Monty Python. Makes sense, with Terry Jones being there. It's a comedy that does not take itself seriously, with outrageous goofy setups and even goofier characters. It's also very, VERY British in that way. If you can't stand British comedy, maybe stay away. I DO like British comedy, except for oooone thing that this game is very bad at.

British Comedy does this thing where if there's a female character, there's like a 90% chance it'll be played by a guy doing the most awful shrill cockney voice you've ever heard in your fucking life. British comedians playing women have ONE voice, and they really, REALLY love to whip it out at any god damn opportunity, and I HATE that voice, it's AWFUL on my ears. This game is lousy with that voice. They got Jess Harnel to play like, one character, and then every other woman in the game is like "ELLO ELLO OIM A GOIYL", clipping the fucking mic.

OTHER THAN THAT, THOUGH, the game is actually very good. Not too long or difficult, it's well worth the time.
