Gamtec were a very special company who's whole deal was making bootlegs on the Sega Genesis. Yep! It's ROCKMAN X3 ON THE SEGA GENESIS.

THAT'S NOT WHERE THAT BELONGS!

This is an extremely jank port of Mega Man X3 to the Genesis. It uh... it looks good? If you look at these pics, you'll never know how uh, weird the music sounds, or how poorly it plays, or how Megaman seems to morph and break apart as he walks, becoming a glitch monstrosity.

There are eight levels, the intro stage (which you do NOT start in and must select from the level map), a Doppler stage (also selectable at any time), Blizzard Buffalo, Gravity Beetle, Volt Catfish, Crush Crawfish, Tunnel Rhino, and Neon Tiger. Blizzard Buffalo and Tunnel Rhino are the bosses in the intro and Doppler stages, and uh... that's it. Once you beat those eight, nothing happens. No end, nothin'. It's almost like an incomplete homebrew demo.

I've never played the ACTUAL Megaman X3, so I dunno if the level design is accurate, but it looks correct, and people in chat said so. Though it IS missing a lot of stuff. A section in the Doppler stage is SUPPOSED to have elevators you hop across to get across spikes, but uh, those aren't here lol

It is not good, and took me 53 minutes, mostly cause I kept dying in Tunnel Rhino's stage, cause when you hit a ceiling, you can't dash anymore and just fall into spikes. This game is worth like, NO points on Retro Achievements, I guess they felt it was too easy, and yeah it is. But man. I dunno if this was worth it lol
