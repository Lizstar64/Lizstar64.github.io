Continuing my random "I want to play Atari Games" kick, this is Math Gran Prix. This is also the only game I'll prolly post with only ONE picture cause uh, that's it. It's just this screen. You control one of the two cars. You choose to move 2 or 3 spaces, then do a math problem. If you do it right, you move that number of spaces. Some of the spaces on the board change how you move, like letting you move ahead random spaces, or letting you choose again. If either of you land on each other, it stuns the other.

It's basically a REALLY shitty math board game. There's no strategy, it's dead simple, and the AI is a shithead that cheats, ALWAYS staying right behind you and knocking you away at the worst point. It's very annoying. I THOUGHT this game would be a goofy little fun time with a bad game, but it was mostly annoying.
