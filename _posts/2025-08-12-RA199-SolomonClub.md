So, last year I played Ice n' Fire for the first time. It's the sequel to a game called Solomon's Key, which I had heard of but never played, and I LOOOOVED Ice n' Fire. So I decided to play Solomon's Key. But the thing about Solomon's Key is it's hard as a mother fucker. Like, really, REALLY hard. So I couldn't beat it, of course. I decided to check out the other game in the series instead, which is basically the same thing, just... not absolute bullshit.

Solomon's Club is basically just Solomon's Key, on gameboy, and minus all that obscure stuff you gotta do to get the good ends. In this game, you still have to do that stuff to get the good end and final world, kinda, but you get the seals for free, so it's fine.

You play as Dana, a wizard, and you're doing... something. It's not really explained. And go through a couple worlds of ten levels each, which are filled with monsters and traps. Dana can create and destroy blocks to the side and below him. He can use this power to climb up, climb down, and reach the exit of each level, all while avoiding the enemies.

You can also collect items and gold as you go along. These items are things like boots to make you go faster, hats to help you break blocks above you faster by bonking into them, fire to kill enemies, water to put out fire, hammers to break enemy spawners, things like that.

The game is really easy in terms of puzzles, the actual problem is the platforming and action, that's what makes it hard. At least until the final world, the bonus challenge world, which has some genuine brain twisters and uses the music from Solomon's Key, which I really love, so it was nice and exciting.

Over all, this is an extremely fun little puzzle game for the gameboy. If Solomon's Key kicked your ass too hard, I recommend checking this one out. Or just play Ice n' Fire, which is one of the best NES games. Either or.
