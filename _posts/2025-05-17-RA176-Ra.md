There's a kind of puzzle that's pretty common in games. You have a bunch of squares, and you can move along them squares. How do you fill in all those squares without stepping back over a square? What path do you take? It's a puzzle I personally associate with the Zelda Oracle games, but it's pretty common elsewhere too. Like here!

This is Pyramids of Ra, a 2018 homebrew Apple II game by Naspite Labs. Seems like a pretty simple homebrew, at least in gameplay. For music, they ported like, a lot of hard techno and keygen jams to Apple II. And considering the computer's limited musical capabilities, it's very crunchy and hurts the ears.

Later on, it introduces different color tiles, which require you to clear them twice, or even three times. Simple progression. After 12-ish stages, the game is done. It's pretty easy, even considering the concept, but I like a puzzle like this, and it doesn't HAVE to be complex or wild to be enjoyable for 20 minutes.
