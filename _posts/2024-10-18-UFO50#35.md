I have a theory I call "8-Bit 2nd Game Syndrome". It's that games from the 8-bit era that evolved into series would try something completely different and weird in the 2nd game, which would be completely ignored in future installations. Mario 2 USA. Zelda 2. Metroid 2. All the black sheep of the franchise. Does Campanella 2, UFO Soft's flagship franchise, suffer the same fate? Well right off the bat, we don't have Pilot! At Joy Akebi's suggestion, he has been deplaced by Isabell, his sister, as the main character, because Pilot has been kidnapped and is being kept in a space station, and Isabell the bounty hunter has to go rescue him!

The game uses the same engine as Campanella, the same fluid smooth UFO movement you know and love, but with a few twists. You can land your UFO and step out of it, very blaster-master style, and enter doors where you travel on foot. Either getting help from people (in rooms that REALLY remind me of Rygar), or a cave with items at the end. Because this isn't your regular level-based game like Campanella 1, or even an adventure game where you explore. Campanella 2 is a roguelike.

All of the levels are randomly generated. At the end of caves, one in each area, you get one of three powerups to choose from, stuff for your blaster, ship, or health/fuel. There are shops that also sell these upgrades. After two levels in the same world, you go through a cave, fight a boss, and move onto the next world. Each area has a bunch of stars floating in it, and once you get 10, the doors close and the exit opens, and you also summon The Bile Of Old. Stay too long, and more will spawn and fucking destroy you in one hit.

Also, in the 2nd area of every world, you have a Sage who will give you a scroll and tell you which world to go to next. Get to all three of them to get the good ending. This isn't too hard, though exploring the big open areas in your UFO can be a little intimidating, because fuel is in VERY short supply. Stars replenish it, yes, but if you get too many of them, you can kiss seeing that sage goodbye. If you DO run out of fuel, you can burn coins, but only for a short time. It's interesting.

When I first played this game, I thought it was the best of the three Campanella games. The most unique, the most creative, the best music. I still think that last bit, but it's cooled on me a bit, and now it's my least favorite. It's still very good, I just like the other two more. It's maybe not different enough in some ways, and sometimes it feels a little rude, like I'm fucked no matter what. But it's still a good fun romp, just not as replayable as the other two, despite its roguelike roots.

8.5/10
