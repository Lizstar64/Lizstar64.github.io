I can't imagine a better game 200.

Kids on Site is a very, VERY special game. I was doing a thing years ago where I was playing every Sega CD game. I hated it. There were so many awful FMV shlock and anime shlock that it wore me down... but there was some good FMV shlock too. And this was the best of them. This game made me so happy to play.

It's hard to describe Kids on Site. It's a collection of silly FMV videos, almost like an interactive movie. You are a kid on a construction site earning some merit badges with different pieces of dangerous equipment. Some adults are there to guide you on what to do. You can move to different screens with A or C (there are 4 screens per level, and each level is a different kind of machine, like steam roller or wrecking ball). B has you perform an action on that screen with your machine. Sometimes there's more actions than one on each screen. And that's it!

Each of the levels is literally just "press B on the correct screen a few times" level of complexity. This is for very little kids who like heavy machinery and want to see it go vroom.

The REAL reason to play Kids on Site are the actors and the wild shit they get up to. This game looked like a LOT of fun to shoot. Everyone is doing those over the top "we're filming for kids" voices. You know, the *clown walks on stage* HI KIDS!!!~ kinda voice. And everyone is a huge manchild with no common sense or empathy. You know, for kids.

It mainly revolves around two characters, Dizzy and Nuts. They're both idiots, and it's a big slapstick kinda thing, because Nuts keeps getting injured over and over. And of course since it's for kids, injured is "gets run over my a steamroller, and is a paper thing on the ground going MMM! MMM! instead of violently murdered by the steamroller"

The things they recorded for this are very silly. You can go bowling with a wrecking ball. You squish multiple kinds of fruit. You dump dirt all over the place.

Frankly, it's just a lot of fun to watch, and I highly, HIGHLY recommend people check it out. I made this set myself, because I KNEW I just had to, and there was an event going on for making Sega CD games.

Roses are red, violets are blue. Bulldozer, bulldozer, I love you!
