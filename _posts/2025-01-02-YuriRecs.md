title: Lizstar's Great Big Post of Yuri Recommendations
subtitle: Gotta study up
categories: oocy
tags: [yuri]
---


A while ago on Cohost, I wrote three big posts of yuri I recommended. It's time to bring them here. So here you go. My yuri recommendations. This will need to be updated sometime, and I will. When that happens, I'll repost it.

***PART 1: FINISHED WORKS***

---

Every damn day before I go to bed, I lay in bed and read yuri until I fall asleep. And then I post cute little snippits from it (or really dumb snippits from it) onto this website for your enjoyment. And I get a lot of people who go "Liz, as the world's leading yuri sommelier, what would you recommend?"

And I always say just ask and I'll give you a yuri or two to tide you over, but someone suggested I just put that shit in a post SO I'MMA PUT THAT SHIT IN A POST

The following is a list of manga that I recommend, alongside a brief description and anything that might be controversial or content warningy. If you like any of these, let me know whatcha think, and consider supporting the artists and writers! You can often find a way to do that on the website I'm linking.

Also, this is not NEARLY a list of EVERYTHING I'd recommend, and I may add to it in the future. I'm also avoiding yuri that's not finished or finished being translated, so there's a LOT of amazing ones that I don't want to get you into and then have you be sad when it never finishes getting translated. If you all like this enough, I might do another one where I recommend a bunch of yuri that's still being worked on. I might also do another post down the line about oneshots I really like. This is ENTIRELY series.

Anyways, bring on the cute girls!

<img src="https://imgur.com/kF4S3vO.png" alt="yuri">

Warnings: Age gap (both adults), parental abuse

This is a historical story taking place either in the late Meiji era or early Taisho. Yuki is a young lower class woman working at a cafe frequented by upper class society. She's a quiet and shy girl who lives her life between work and her books, her favorite of which are by the fluffy romance author, Azuma Beniko. So when Azuma Sensei shows up in her cafe, it overwhelms her. And then Azuma says that she wants to use Yuki as reference for her new novel...


<img src="https://imgur.com/krSflRf.png" alt="yuri">

Read this if you like: Extreme fluff, light drama, hot women playing with soft shy women.

If you like this, you should read: Literally anything else written by the author, Nagori Yu. She has a type, is what I'm saying. This is, to my belief, the only thing she has ever actually FINISHED, but all of her unfinished manga that's halfway through has this dynamic of hot powerful woman and shy cute woman.

***

<img src="https://imgur.com/IwUz5ve.png" alt="yuri">

Warnings: Oh boy, a lot. Age Gap (both adults), starts with sexual assault, power imbalance dynamics, light ecchi

Okay now listen, when I describe the conceit of this manga to you, you are not gonna like the sound of it. This is the hardest manga to recommend but it's also one of my favorites, okay? Here we go.

Koduka-san is a game dev who has recently gotten fired from her job. She's drowning her sorrows in alcohol, and is unable to function or pay rent. Her landlord (the manga CALLS her a landlord, and Miss Landlord, but she's really more of a person who works at the apartment complex managing it and working with the occupants, she does not own the building) comes by to check up on her and gives her an offer on how to keep living there. The offer, at least through Koduka's drunk haze, seems to be "sleep with me, and you can stay here". So Koduka does.

Once she awakens, she immediately regrets it, and Miss Landlord gives her another offer. She can stay there with her, and if Koduka "services" her, she will consider the debt repaid.

Now I know how this sounds. It sounds fucking horrible. But trust me, this is actually a REALLY good manga. It's light and fluffy, but is built on MASSIVE misunderstandings that will eventually give way to almost slice of life pleasantness as these two live together and grow closer.

<img src="https://imgur.com/IbmrqFA.png" alt="yuri">

Read this manga if you like: Lots of fluff and can put up with a bit to get there, enjoy seeing "straight" girls realize "oh shit wait why DID I immediately jump to having sex with her", idiot couples, medium levels of drama

<a href="https://dynasty-scans.com/series/after_school">After School</a>
***

<img src="https://imgur.com/i5rGE6z.png" alt="yuri">

Warnings: School girls in high school, lightly echii. Nothing explicit, but they are REALLY makin' out.

Shiine and Ichika aren't quite friends. Barely even acquaintances. They know of each other, as the other... fascinates them in a way they can't explain, but they never had a chance to interact. However, at the start of the school year, they're both selected as class representatives, and thus work together on the student council. After Ichika is late to a meeting, Shiine offers to help tell her what she missed, and they begin to talk to get to know each other... and the conversation goes to kissing.

Ichika assumes Shiine has dated and kissed COUNTLESS boys, after all, she's so hot and cool. Shiine hasn't but feels embarassed and embraces the lie. So Ichika wants to know... what is it like to kiss...?

<img src="https://imgur.com/pg1JuX8.png" alt="yuri">

Once the two start... they fall into a routine. Once a week, sometimes even two or three times a week, after school, the two meet up and kiss each other. They're less than friends, but also more than friends. Kissing friends. Can they move past how they feel and become something even more?

Read this manga if you like: EXTREME LEVELS OF FLUFF. OVERLOAD. OVERLOAD. Girls making out with girls. Idiot couple, like holy shit REALLY BIG IDIOT COUPLE ENERGY. "THIS GIRL KEEPS ASKING ME TO MAKE OUT WITH HER EVERY DAY AFTER SCHOOL I WONDER IF SHE LIKES ME LIKE I LIKE HER"

***

<img src="https://imgur.com/hNCh9Lt.png" alt="yuri">

Warnings: Light to medium drama. Abusive relationships, stalking. Homophobic and abusive fathers.

This one is Thai, so if you read it and think the vibe is different, it very much is! And so are the names. Trust me, these are the character's actual names in the story. This isn't some mistranslation.

Donut is a young girl who is just entering college. She's nerdy, not conventionally attractive, and has never really experienced love. One day she runs into an older student at the dorm washing machine, a cool lady named Mew. Mew is friendly, and maybe a little... flirty? No, that couldn't be, they're both girls! The two hit it off as friends, and find out they're actually neighbors! What a coincidence!

This is a story of their friendship as it grows into something more!

<img src="https://imgur.com/L9skYI9.png" alt="yuri">
<img src="https://imgur.com/UjMu2eG.png" alt="yuri">

Read this if you like: Girls who are more experienced picking up "straight" girls. Simple concepts. This one doesn't have some major grand arching plot, except for some stuff involving an ex. It's not OVERLY fluffy, but it's good pleasant romance.

Warnings: Sexual Assault in backstory. Sick grandmothers as a plot point. Mid level drama.

Ms. Takase is a woman who works from home, and rarely leaves her house. She is afraid of the outside world, and others, after she was sexually assaulted at her old work, and her coworkers blamed her for it. Now she just wants nothing more than to be alone... until her delivery girl, who brings her her weekly groceries and other things, enters her life. Rinko is a bright and cheerful girl from the boonies, and while Ms. Takase is hesitant at first, they quickly become friends... or perhaps more?

The monster, for the first time in her life, lies, and claims she is a traveler, wandering far and wide. Lily asks her to tell her stories, and the monster recounts stories from the books she's read so that she can keep this girl as her friend. As the monster has no name, Lily names her Heath, after her favorite flower.

<img src="https://imgur.com/CZ5DsVD.png" alt="yuri">

Warnings: MAJOR age gap. One girl is a senior in high school and the other is nearing her 30s. Their relationship is "pure", but y'know, that's still massive squick.

This is a cute couple life manga about Hina-chan, a high school student, and her girlfriend, an office lady named Yayoi-san. Yayoi can't take care of herself, and Hina comes over and cooks for her and other such things. It's mostly cute sweet fluff, but has huge themes of age, maturity, and growing up.

<img src="https://imgur.com/7B63HCf.png" alt="yuri">

Read this if you like: The themes of maturity and growth. Couple life manga. If you handle such a large age gap, it's actually quite good. Just y'know, illegal.

Warnings: Blackmail, kinda noncon

Ayaka is a young girl in highschool who wants to be JUST like her older brother, who is the perfect student and perfect older brother. She wants to get top marks like him and go to his college, which is REALLY hard to get into... but she's absolutely TERRIBLE at taking tests. So her teacher offers to give her a recommendation so she can get in easily, if she'll just get the delinquent, Honda-san, to actually come to school. Honda isn't your typical delinquent. She's kind of a quiet emotionless girl who just... doesn't want to come to school, possibly due to depression.

Honda learns of Ayaka's deal with the teacher, which worried Ayaka. If word gets out that she's doing favors to get a recommendation, it could kill her socially with the other students! But Honda san offers a deal. If Ayaka does whatever Honda asks her to do, once per day, then Honda won't tell anyone. And what kind of things will Honda tell her to do?

<img src="https://imgur.com/NnGYXas.png" alt="yuri">

Yep! Gay things!

Read this if you like: Shockingly wholesome stuff. Like, considering how it starts with noncon kissing, it evolves in a great way. Read this if you like seeing someone come to grips with loving someone else and just being too fucking dense to realize it.

Warnings: Major angst

Nanaki and Kanade couldn't be further opposites. Nanaki is a gyaru who is OBSESSED with being the prettiest girl. She's rude and forceful, and a bit of a bully. Kanade, meanwhile, is a shy and quiet otaku wallflower. However, once Nanaki is dumped brutally by her cheating boyfriend, she can't go to any of her friends, because they're just as cruel and as big bullies as she is. So who is there to support her and give her a shoulder to cry on? The "ugly" wallflower, Kurosawa Kanade.

<img src="https://imgur.com/RRGzZun.png" alt="yuri">

Thus begins Nanaki's slow character growth and transformation as she and Kanade grow closer...

Read this if you like: Major character growth plots. LOTS of angst and drama, no one in this manga is actually alright deep down.

<a href="https://dynasty-scans.com/series/tadokoro_san_web_comic">Tadokoro-San</a>
***

<img src="https://imgur.com/yfUTLLg.png" alt="yuri">

Warnings: Very lewd

This one is interesting cause at one point, it was my #1 suggestion. I LOVED this manga. It's severeled cooled on me though, especially after it just unceremoniously ended, with the artist ending it with a big sex scene that felt a little odd, after the entirely of the manga. Anyways, the description.

Tadokoro-san is a quiet gloomy otaku in high school. She draws manga and keeps to herself. Sakurako, meanwhile, is the school idol. She's gorgeous, rich, and perfect in every way. So when Sakurako falls hopelessly in love with Tadokoro after seeing her art and how adorable she is, Tadokoro can't help but be overwhelmed.

<img src="https://imgur.com/eLERBx1.png" alt="yuri">
<img src="https://imgur.com/8ltUki1.png" alt="yuri">

Read this if you like: Essentially yandere, without any of the actual violence or death or anything. Sakurako is BASICALLY yandere levels of in lvoe with Tadokoro. So, read this if you like seeing really horny girls be VERY horny for other girls, because that's like 70% of this manga. Also lots of height gap and gap-moe.

Warnings: This is practically just porn, it's so ecchi.

This is one of the goofier ones I'll recommend. 

i got this new anime plot. basically there's this high school girl except she's got huge boobs. i mean some serious honkers. a real set of badonkers. packin some dobonhonkeros. massive dohoonkabhankoloos. big ol' tonhongerekoogers. what happens next?! transfer student shows up with even bigger bonkhonagahoogs. humongous hungolomghononoloughongous.

In all seriousness, there's two girls. The cool prince of the school, Chiaki, and Harumi, who is a normal school girl who happens to have some serious honkers. Chiaki confesses to Harumi, but not y'know, a love confession. This isn't about love. This isn't even about sex or perversion! Chiaki just REALLY likes tits.

<img src="https://imgur.com/fuIz8dI.png" alt="yuri">

Chiaki must grope Harumi like, once a day, or she will run out of energy. Boobs are her recharging spot. She LIVES for boobs. This manga is so fucking stupid but I kinda like it anyway?

Warning: MASSIVE angst. Abusive relationships. Cheating. Pregnancy. Lots of self enforced heterosexuality and internal homophobia.

Maki and Midori dated all through highschool. Come the end of highschool, however, Midori decided to call it off. After all, they were "too old" to be "playing" at that anymore, right? They had to grow up. Start a family.

Ten years later, by a chance of luck, the two run into each other again! Midori is living her dream. She's getting married, and she gets to meet her old highschool best friend again! At least, things look good... on the surface. Her marriage is worse than it looks, and re-discovering this long lost love isn't helping. Can the two of them run away together, away from all of this?

Warnings: None I can think of

Hinako wants to be normal. She just doesn't GET it. All her life, she's been surrounded by a society that tells her she should fall in love. But she can't. No matter what, she can't. And then she ends up getting closer to her coworker in the office, Satou-san, a serious working scary girl... and something begins to change. But it's not what society always told her it would be. What is this new feeling?

***

<img src="https://imgur.com/Aw0AA33.png" alt="yuri">

Warnings: Really pushy girl with a crush

This comic is TECHNICALLY still going, but it's two chapters away from the end and you can read it early if you pay. Which I have. So it goes here.

The Demon Queen sits up at the top of her tower. Whichever adventurer can reach the stop, through 100 floors and her right generals, can take her head and gain the admiration of the human kingdom and riches beyond their wildest dreams. But to reach that point, not even just kill the queen, you have to be top of your class. And the top of the adventurer guild's school is none other than the mage Malori.

Too bad Malori has NO INTEREST in actually killing the Demon Queen and getting all that power and riches. No, she wants to marry the Demon Queen instead. 

<img src="https://imgur.com/irQKTwR.png" alt="yuri">
<img src="https://imgur.com/SERkZsq.png" alt="yuri">

Read this if you like: Slow burn with one girl head over heels. Idiot couples. Comedy, this one is actually very funny. Video games, it's heavily inspired by JRPGs and is in an Isekai world, but is NOT actually an Isekai story, just takes place in a world where people from Earth get Isekai'd to.

Warnings: Vampires. Blood. Violence. Older than she looks age gap, though she's still mentally a child, she IS a vampire.

Ichika is a normal kid. Her grandmother, a shrine maiden, just passed away. On the day of her funeral, a strange foreign girl named Aria appears... who claims to have been her grandma's friend. She needs Ichika to do something for her, something ONLY maidens of this shrine can do. Aria wants Ichika to kill her.

<img src="https://imgur.com/6ascKPB.png" alt="yuri">

What follows is a strange romance story where Ichika can't help but fall in love with the terrifying, but very attractive vampire.

Also I fucking LOVE the art in this one.

Yuxuan, however, is a shy tomboy, who isn't into fashion whatsoever. But the two become friends anyway.

Warning: Some might have finished since making this a year ago

<img src="https://imgur.com/S69iZRO.png" alt="yuri">

Warnings: Harem. One of the pairings is teacher x student. college kids.

Mei-chan just graduated highschool with her heart broken. The girl she was crushing on, her best friend, is straight as can be. Now that she's going into college she's decided not only will she reinvent herself, but she'll GET A GIRLFRIEND! Very quickly, however, she meets five girls that she immediately falls head over heels in love with, and they also seem to be pretty into her, each in their own ways...

You have Riri, the touchy snuggly sweet friend who's a bit reserved and shy, but has a surprising past as a sexy model. There's Maria-Sensei, a psychology professor at the college who is The Mommy type and thinks Mei is the cuttest thing in the world. Minato Senpai, a prince-like older student who's extremely into music, sound, and especially ASMR, and immediately falls in love with Mei's voice, and also gets Mei involved in the local arts scene. That art scene also includes Karin-Senpai, an aspiring actor who is a kiss demon playgirl who IMMEDIATELY starts making out with Mei. Then finally, there's Mei's roommate, the irreverent ace senpai Kaoru, who takes a liking to Mei... and has a tendency to have her Switch Get Flipped when smelling Kaoru, due to a rather strong kink.

Yes, every character loves Mei for a different reason, and they're all based on the five senses.

<img src="https://imgur.com/6mbLSLu.png" alt="yuri">

No real clue where this one is going yet. It seems to ME to be a deconstruction of a lot of harem anime tropes, intentionally, and a bit of a parody of the idea, while also just being a good gay harem manga. Pretty much all the characters are fun in their own way. It's 100% possible this will go the mythical route, the route that people like me would DREAM of seeing in a harem manga: THE POLYAMORY ROUTE. But we will have to see.

Read this if you're into: Cute blushing girls. Girls being OBVIOUSLY super into each other. Lots of horny energy. A varied and fun cast.

If you like this, consider checking out: Tamamusi's previous works. Bright and Cheery Amnesia girl is good and I would have recommended it in my previous post but that post was 18 works long and I needed to stop somewhere. That one is a goofy romance about a girl who loses her memories, reverts to her high school self, and finds out she's ten years older and has a banging hot girlfriend now.

***<a href="https://dynasty-scans.com/series/anemone_is_in_heat">Anemone Is In Heat</a>***

<img src="https://imgur.com/aOPXNqb.png" alt="yuri">

Warnings: High school girls. Mild drama. 

Nagisa has just entered high school. It was not her first highschool choice... she, in fact, failed the exam for her first choice, because she missed the exam time because she was helping a sick girl. In her shame of failure, she reinvents herself, becoming a cool beauty. On her first day at her new school, however, she finds out that same girl who caused her to fail is in her class! And though she knows it's not her fault, she can't help but hate this student, Mashiro. Mashiro, however, quickly takes a liking to Nagisa...

<img src="https://imgur.com/Q7NKsSC.png" alt="yuri">

This quickly evolves into some cute fluff romance between the two of them as they grow closer, both trying to change who they are. Nagisa doesn't want to hate Mashiro for something she couldn't control, and Mashiro wants to stop being a sickly burden on everyone. They carry each other out of this depression and these negative feelings. There's also side romances that I'll be real, I'm not as into. Nagisa and Mashiro are the real stars.

Read this if you like: blushing girls who can barely contain crushes but don't quite get it yet. Some mild drama but nothing serious.


***<a href="https://www.amazon.com/She-Loves-Cook-Eat-Vol/dp/1975348826">She Loves to Cook, and She Loves to Eat</a>***

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/vB3ry3V.png" alt="yuri">

Cooking is how Nomoto de-stresses, but she has a tendency to cook way more than she could ever possibly eat by herself. So she invites her neighbor Kasuga, who lives alone and seems to really enjoy her food. What evolves from this is a close relationship, born of food and a love for it, which grows closer with each meal.

<img src="https://imgur.com/6vVFbqR.png" alt="yuri">

This one is honestly pretty stunning. What starts as just a cute slice of life slow burn romance becomes one of the gayest god damn things. It has commentary on everything LGBT, with good ace rep, and you get real invested in the romance between these two.

Read this one if you like: Gay women. Seriously. Also, food. Every chapter is about cooking a different dish.

Warnings: Highschool girls. Not much else.

Chidori and Nanoha are best friends. But even more than that, they are in love. But they keep their relationship a secret from everyone. Hiding from prying eyes, they spend their days flirting sneakily, fretting from the constant interruptions.


<img src="https://imgur.com/Gh38jfV.png" alt="yuri">

<img src="https://imgur.com/zEkhBFK.png" alt="yuri">

This is a slice of life manga about two girlfriends in an all girl school who are hiding their relationship because they don't want to be teased by their friends. Not like, in a homophobic way. More in a "we will never hear the end of it" way. So this is easier. It's simple and cute.

Read this if you like: Simple, slice of life. Very VERY mild drama, if any at all. Idiot couples.

Warnings: High school girls.

Minami and Yuzu are close as friends can be. Friends and neighbors all their lives, they are inseperable, doing everything together. They're quite opposites, the two of them: Minami is a serious hardworker who hyperfocuses on things she puts her mind to and is friendly and well loved at school, and Yuzu is an ADHD addled spacey girl who really only focuses on her hobbies and interests, like astronomy, and is kinda shy and keeps to herself. But they've been together as long as they can remember, and nothing will ever change that!

Then one day, Minami overhears Yuzu being confessed to... and she realizes something about herself.

Warnings: Incest as a plot point. Pushy main character (it chills out extremely after the first few chapters).

So, there's a genre of manga that is very, very popular. Isekai into an otome game, where the main character falls in love with the villain of that story. I'm about to post like, three of these in a row, and they all have similar tropes and ideas, but are all good in their own ways.

In this one, ordinary office worker Rei wakes one day to find she's in the body of the protagonist of her favorite otome game, Revolution. She knows this world inside and out, as she's one of the most prolific fanfic writers of this world, so she's researched it back and forth, especially involving her favorite character, the villainess, Vlaire Francois. The character has a tragic end in the story of the game, and Rei always wrote fanfic to change that. Now that she's the mary sue protagonist, with incredible magic power, she will do everything in her power to protect Claire. The same Claire who hates commoners and is annoyed at Rei's very existence.

She is summoned, through her phone, to the world by the villainess, Lapis Tenenbrae, who is a cold chessmaster that Mitori knows is going to start a genocide against commoners. But Mitori, who had just been fired and was finding it hard to continue to live, now is given a new place to live, and new work to do, as her "miraculous future-telling" (she just knows the story very well) and office worker skills gets her hired by Lapis as her personal secretary. Mitori finally has a place to belong. And she decides, she's going to do everything in her power to save Lapis and give the story a happy end.

Yvonne has been reincarnated into the world of an otome game as the rich villainess! According to the game's plot, her loathsome role is to do little more than bully and mistreat the poor heroine of the story, Elsa. Yvonne doesn't want to fit into her new role, but the game has a built in Villainess System that will punish her and harm those she cares about if she doesn't do exactly what it says. It's hard to do that though, when she doesn't want to hurt Elsa, and when Elsa seems to be... intentionally getting closer and closer to Yvonne, almost as if...

A Magical Girl, with her enchanted plushy Lappi, saves the world from the Dark Queen, thus granting herself one wish. Her wish is to stay with Lappi forever. Now, many years in the future, Lappi finds herself living with Megu, the office girl. She wishes she could do SOMETHING to earn her keep, but she's just a little stuffie...

A cute and interesting oneshot. I think some people might find this Very Weird, because it's a sentient plushie and a human woman. But uh, I find it *adorable*. There's also a lot of metaphor going on here, with parallels to like, disability and such. Very sweet, and one of my absolute favorites. But y'know, you're warned. It can be seen as Weird.

Akiho wakes up early for once in her life and takes the early bus to school. No one else is around this early, except for a single girl who's also taking the bus. She's a prim and proper girl from the rich school, but the two hit it off quickly...

Tamaki is a new hire at a deli, and hits it off quickly with Saho, becoming good friends. A boy also keeps coming to the Deli to flirt with Saho, which seems to bother Tamaki. Saho becomes convinced that Tamaki must like him, and that's why she's bothered! It's time to fix this, for Tamaki's sake!

I love the character designs in this. Saho is a girl on the larger side, but it's not treated as anything more than just, what she is. It's never mentioned or mocked. In fact, everyone loves her, she's very sweet. Also EVERYTHING Sal makes is just, amazing.

This one is about one of my absolutely favorite topics in yuri, one I don't see often. Happy families, two loving women and their kid(s). Or as Dynasty Scans calls it, uh, "non-science babies". Dynasty Scan's tag system is weird sometimes.

Hina is a young pre-schooler who gets into a spat with her overworked and exhausted mother, who isn't even LISTENING to her! Her mom's wife, Ric-chan, tried to teach her how important her mother is, but she's so young. It's a fluffy and sweet loving family, and like all families, they have some rough spots now and then, but they'll make it through, to a sunny tomorrow.

Rin is a young girl who's confessed to by a girl! That's weird, isn't it, a girl liking another girl? Uh no, of course not. After all, Rin has two moms. Why would that be weird?

More cute family stuff.

CW: Age Gap, kinda? In like, both ways. You'll see what I mean.

Miyazaki hits her head one day and wakes up in the infirmary. The class rep comes in to check on her. She's always been distant to Miyazaki before, though Miyazaki has a crush on her. While visiting, however, Miyazaki keeps hearing her voice, even though she's not speaking. And the class rep seems to have VERY strong feelings about her...

Fussa is an actual IRL city in Japan, which has a US military base on it. One day, while walking by the chain link fence seperating the two countries, Risa meets a young American girl named Delphi living on the other side. The two, despite not speaking each other's languages, want to become closer! Can they cross both the language barrier, and the actual physical barrier, and become closer?

I love language barrier stuff and international love (I wonder why this is so important to me huh), so this one hits me in a good way.

CW: Technically age gap, they're both adults but Meg is apparently an ancient and powerful witch, though she just looks like a young woman.

Lilith is a Witch Hunter, and Meg is the Grand Witch. Meg's whole deal is she like causing mischief out of boredom, so Lilith is here to stop her. They play cat and mouse a lot, but things get a little wild when Meg manages to cast a curse on Lilith.

A good two parter. I feel like there can, and SHOULD, be more.

But that doesn't matter for her relationship with Haruka, because Haruka is blind. When Haruka has the opportunity to gain her sight back with a surgery, Keiko doesn't know what to think. She cares about Haruka deeply, but if she could actually see her... would Haruka want anything to do with her anymore?
