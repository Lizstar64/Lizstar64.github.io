Color Dreams is at it again! This is a rather infamous one by them in some circles. It never got BIG attention cause it wasn't covered by AVGN or anything, but for those who've played it, oh boy. This isn't their worst game or anything, but it is interesting, because this game was never released! Yes, they decided Menace Beach was fine, but this was just too much for the market.

You play as Some Dude and you've got to escape Atlantis. A volcano is erupting and shit is bad. That's it, that's your story. You can run and you can VERY awkwardly jump. It's kind of top down, but kinda isometric? It's like a 3/4th view from a drone above.

This game is nonsense. Each level requires you to do a new different thing to proceed, and this game is inscrutable. Cannot be scruted. Like it starts fine enough I guess? Beating enemies on the screen is a pretty simple puzzle, but by the end when you're breaking down walls, but you have to break it in the RIGHT WAY, it's just rough. If you die, you don't immediately die, you get sent to Hades, where you need to collect hearts. If you get enough, you return to life. Get touched by Death, and you're gone. Luckily this is VERY easy, so it's practically infinite continues, and you're gonna use 'em.

The music is rough, the art is VERY rough, I love that horrible little guy. Look at this AWFUL box art, why s his head so large, what the hell is going on with his facial hair?! This guy looks like a dude who'd be drinking little ales in a hipster bar. This game is bad, but if you're following a guide, it takes like 30 minutes, and it's fun to point and laugh.
