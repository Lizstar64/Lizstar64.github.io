You don't hear about many 32x homebrew. I think a lot of it is that no one really cares about or likes the 32x, but no one's going out of their way to make any homebrew for it. Except for this, I guess. This is Double Symbol by Timur Lyazgiev. It's a pretty simple puzzle game.

Ever played tile matching memory games? Then you've played Double Symbol. The screen is revealed at the start, then you ned to match them together as quickly as you can for extra points. I think you can lose but I don't know how because I never did. After you match all the tiles, that's a stage clear.

There are 80 stages.

I don't think I need to tell you that this is a game you play for two stages and get enough of. I ended up just taking a picture of each of the screens when they were first revealed, and cheating. It still took me like an hour and a half. There's nothing WRONG with this, it feels like another homebrew made as a test. But it doesn't use the 32x's power in any way, and isn't super fun.
