Three years and 27 games after her introduction, the Space Pirate Alpha returns! Remember, she's the Samus-esque character from Velgress. After her struggles in Velgress, she's broke with no ship. Her only hope of getting the money for a new ship is to fight in the Red Arena, a blood sport arena where the more you fight, the more you win.

Overbold is a Smash TV-esque arena fighter, where you choose how many enemies you fight each round. The more you add on, the more you make, in quantities of 100. You can then use that money to upgrade yourself, with random upgrades costing more or less each round. After like 8 or so rounds, you'll fight a round that's INSTANTLY at max difficulty, with a boss. Beat that, and boom, you win. In each battle, you can run around, avoiding enemy fire and lava pits. You have a gun that travels the whole distance of the arena, and bombs, which can and WILL kill you, but instantly kill almost everything.

As you may be able to tell from the fact I just described the entire game in a paragraph, and not a particularly large one, this game isn't very complex. Honestly, to its detriment. I know a lot of people who really like Overbold, and I have no fucking idea why. It's fine, yeah, but it feels MASSIVELY undercooked, like it just has no ideas. There's a SINGLE arena, runs will take you like 10 minutes, and while it's got some challenge to it, that's not really enough to carry the game for me.

Sorry :/
