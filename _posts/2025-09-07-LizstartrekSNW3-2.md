Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you're curious about a nerd's views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I've watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!

This is the third season of SNW, finally coming out. We're gonna watch an episode of this once a week until we finish, alongside Voyager, cause it's coming out y'know, one a week. Yay! I love SNW!



**Through the Lens of Time** - SNW
5/10

This season is going really hard on the romance drama, which is starting to get mostly tiring for me. But it's ALSO pushing this new nurse guy, Dana. He's SO excited and happy to be here. This guy is SO fucking dead. He's got the voice over and it's really pushing him, he's so fucked. It also seems like he was brought in secretly as a third wheel so that thigns aren't TOO awkward between Spock and Korby as they do some kind of dig.

Ortegas' brother is also here! He's recording stuff for a documentary, it seems, and is also invited to this mission, which SEEMS to be an archaeological dig on a sacred site. He's also getting romance vibes with Uhura. They're really trying to hook EVERYONE up this season aren't they? Though Pelia the Warpcore Witch also seems to be real into him. And I like that, cause it's funny.

They all enter some kind of temple, after Chapel does some kind of thing to gain entry. They IMMEDIATELY find corpses and Spock is like "okay, protocol tells is we need to leave now". Korby gets pissy and refuses, and Chapel, who's in charge of the mission, sides with him cause he's her girlfriend. There's also a lot of tension cause of the whole Spock x Chapel thing. See, this is why everyone shouldn't just fuck. Use the holodeck to fuck- wait. We already had an episode about how that's a bad idea at this time.

New Kid, who's name is Gamble, acts like a TOS red shirt and randomly touches shit. Anyways, woah, New Kid gets his fucking eyes exploded cause things are actually super dangerous in here! Looks like Spock was right, what a mother fucking shock! The native living with them sees something else, freaks the fuck out, and tries to run away, and is vaporized. But we have so many things we could learn here!!! Korby was ABSOLUTELY going to just fucking die because he wasn't being careful enough if others didn't die before him, frankly. Why was he SO SURE that he had to do this dig RIGHT THE FUCK NOW? "I've waited all my life for this!" Yeah dude, but you're like, 33. This temple isn't going anywhere. Put down that fucking idiot ball, right now, mister!

They get split up, as if it couldnt' get any worse, and are in different rooms, but able to communicate. This now turns into a split room puzzle game escape room. Seems to be the same room but also not, seperate dimensions. They can still communicate though. Why? I dunno, bad writing?

The Eyeball Regenerator, which apparently exists, is not working. New Kid's brain is also registering as braindead. New episode name: Gamble's Brain. Gamble is also acting Kinda Sus now. Hmm.

Ten minutes ago, Gamble's eyes exploded. Now, Spock is saying how Korby is not being safe enough and not taking any precautions, and then he TAKES A FUCKING VISOR OFF OF A DEAD ALIEN AND PUTS IT ON HIS EYEBALLS AND USES IT TO LOOK AT THINGS. WHAT THE FUCK, SPOCK? I'm starting to think this episode might just not be well written.

Patel, who I remind you is now half Gorn, meets Gamble, and starts speaking in tongues. Gamble does the same, and they proceed to beat the shit out of each other. Gamble also murders someone in the scuffle. After he's captured, he just breaks through the force fields and kills more red shirts. Damn, this episode has a body count.

Pelia shoots Gamble in the back, releasing the ancient dimensional alien inside of him. Scotty then captures it in a Pokeball and tosses it up into the transporter. He locks it in the transport buffer, until they can figure out what to do with it. There's no WAY that'll backfire!!!

Pelia has a big discussion about ancient evil, which turns out to be her mugging for the documentary. Okay, that was funny. I was like "wow that's very on the nose- oh okay, that's good". I do like Pelia. As M'Benga calls Gamble's parents to tell them about their son, the Enterprise computer screens flash alien text. Wow, I knew it'd backfire but THAT fast.

I think my judgement of this will depend on if and when it goes anywhere, but I feel it was poorly written. Something was off and the pacing was bad.
