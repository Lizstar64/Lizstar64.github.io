I was looking through some random early gameboy games one day, and I found this one. I'd never heard of it. Mr. Chin's Gourmet Paradise by Romstar. It's one of the absolute weirdest gameboy games I've played. Conceptually, gameplay wise, it's not THAT weird. But... hmm.

In this game, you play as Mr. Chin. He lives in a world with these little creatures, Momos. They kinda look like the fires from Donkey Kong. You're dropped into a single screen platformer (though it usually scrolls left to right), and can jump and place... what looks kind of like a mine. If you place two of these mines at the same layer, they will connect together with a laser. And any of those momos inbetween turn into peaches, his favorite food.

The manual makes it clear this is morally reprehensible. He's turning these cute little critters into food, killing and eating them. It's kinda fucked up.

Other than that, it's a simple single screen platformer type deal. Eat all the monsters, move to the next stage. Your score is labeled as "kcal" which is kinda funny.

All in all, this is a fine game, though it is very so SLIGHTLY jank, and pretty simple. You've got some power ups, like one that lets you fly, but it's really just like 10 stages and that's it. They're pretty easy to learn, cause the enemy patterns are the same every time. Committing warcrimes has never been this fun(?)
