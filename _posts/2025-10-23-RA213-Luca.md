This was a biiiiig one.

I like Sudoku quite a bit. Half a decade ago, I was in a really bad spot, and sudoku was one of the only things I could do to distract myself and calm myself down. I haven't done much sudoku since then, but when this set came out, I decided I'd give it a try. This is Luca no Puzzle de Daibouken, a Gameboy Color game with a LOT of Sudoku puzzles on it. How many? 200.

I know the title screen says "2" by the way. I dunno why. It's not the second.

The game has three modes. The first is 100 puzzles, each 20 of which unlock a new mini game in the mini game mode. These save and note as being beaten. After you beat all 100, you unlock 100 MORE puzzles. These are not the same puzzles but like, there's nothing differentiating them basically. The ONLY difference is you can't save in the middle of a puzzle, like in the other mode for some reason.

Other than that, it sure is sudoku! It's got a cute energy and alright music. I like the ocean and dolphins are adorable. There's one problem, though. See this cute screen with all the fish in the background? Well yes, that's the only screen for 200 puzzles, but most importantly, those numbers are WAY too small for me to read. Luckily, the game has a zoom in feature to make the entire screen the puzzle. But that also means... what's the point. It's JUST sudoku at that point.

I did 4 puzzles every day for months. It was very calming and pleasant for a while, just starting every stream with an hour and a half of sudoku. By the end I was ready to be done with it, to be honest. It was like 170 hours of fucking Sudoku. Even for someone who likes it, that's a lot.

At least the dolphin is cute, though.
