We've got the core team for LX Systems, there won't be too many changes for at least a little while, so there's not much to say about this game other than to talk about the game itself.

Attactics is a strategy action game that's pretty different from anything I've played. It's a realtime turnbased game. You've got a 5x8 grid, and units will spawn randomly on each side of it. Those units will then move every single turn, depending on what kind of unit they are. Turns go automatically, every few seconds. However, you can grab and shift your units, moving them up and down, or back. You can shift and swap units this way, as well, for maximum strategy. When a unit kills another, it gets a promotion and deals extra damage. The goal is to just get enough units to the enemy's side, to knock down all their flags, and you win!

You've got a bunch of unit types, each with different strengths and weaknesses. Grunts will be immune to melee damage if they're in a column of 3 or more units. Archers will shoot from afar if a unit is in their sight, instead of moving. Shieldmen are tanky as fuck and can block arrows. Cavalry move twice, good for sneaking through weak spots and getting quick damage in. Spearmen attack two spaces instead of just 1, through units, good for hiding behind shieldmen. Assassins will throw daggers up and down as they walk. Sappers will explode when they die, which blows up the enemy, but can ALSO blow YOU up. Aaand then there's heroes, unique units that happen every 5 promotions on certain stages, and they move twice as far, pierce two stages, and start promoted like, 5. They're good.

And that's it! Battles are tense and hectic. The AI can't move at all, so it usually gets like, 70% more units to compensate. I imagine multiplayer is WILD. The description of the game explains that the game was delayed cause the devs just wouldn't stop playing it, and the credits show that "Chiffon the Strong" was the office champion. It just shows how the vibe was in those days at the office. Their games aren't selling... amazingly, but they're loving what they're doing.

This one was pretty alright, and then grew on me a bit more. It's nothing amazing, but it's fun for what it is. And not super long.
