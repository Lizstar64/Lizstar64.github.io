So, I recently graduated from Jr Dev to Full Dev. That means I can make sets. My first set I made was this.

Super Locomotive is my favorite arcade game. I've already talked about it at length, I don't have much more to add. Go check out my older review of it, I just didn't want to skip entries. This is one of my favorite games of all time, a fantastic arcade game, a STUNNINGLY fantastic arcade game for fucking 1982, and well worth your time.
