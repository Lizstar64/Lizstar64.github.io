If I thought the last game was a failure as education AND entertainment, this goes beyond that.

This is a game made by like one dude and published by Mindscape in 1985. It is MASSIVELY simple. You choose a difficulty, and then one or two players. Then, the game gives you a simple math problem. Depending on how fast you answer it, you hop around a board. Whoever reaches the end first wins.

Even for a game for kindergarteners learning basic addition, I just don't think there's anything here. The colors and art are drab, the sounds are not good, the concept is boring and uninteresting. I'm sorry, this is one of the least games I've reviewed so far. It sure did count towards the event I'm doing on RA, though!
