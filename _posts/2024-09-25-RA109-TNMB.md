This is one of the weirder ones.

Okay, so Telenet Japan was a game company in the 80s, very influential at the time. They made a bunch of games that, at the time, were big deals. Nowadays, not so much. You've got stuff like Valis, XZR, a bunch of great shmups, they were a big publisher too, publishing Wolf Team's magnum opus, Earnest Evans. LOTS of stuff on Sega consoles, too. But this is a very, very weird one of their's.

This is a music program. It has a bunch of songs from their different games, all in one spot. This is FASCINATING to us today, the idea that Nintendo would be like "okay here's a game on the Switch, it's just 12 soundtracks from our most popular games". But that's how it was! Where the hell else were you gonna listen to all of these? The GAMES THEMSELVES? Fuck that noise.

So yeah, there's not much to it. But it's a cute and fascinating little thing, plus it has a lot of great music. XZR has some damn good music, I tell ya. And the art is really nice, too.

If you wanna hear some music, check it out:
