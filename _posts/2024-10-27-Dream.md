Had a dream last night that Games Done Quick was taking place in my Elementary School's cafeteria this year

They had a giant pool installed in the ground, and one of the most anticipated runs of the year was a real life run where my friend Dowolf was going to swim, with no gear, in the pool, and the walls and floors would rise up and move out and try to squish him, and he had to dodge them.

This seemed COMPLETELY normal to me.
