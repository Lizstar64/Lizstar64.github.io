Blue Mint is a Doujin game on the PC88 by Caramel Ribbon. It's a program for the PC88 that shows you 80s anime styled art, and then you need to unjumble it in a sliding puzzle. That's it! There are six puzzles and then you're done.

The puzzles get progressively larger. They start as like, 3x3s, until they get to about 8x6s or so. A sliding puzzle is the ssame no matter the size, if you know what you're doing. Honestly, I played this cause it was 1AM I wasn't tired, and I needed something chill to play through a high anxiety night. This was chill. There's not much more to it than that.
