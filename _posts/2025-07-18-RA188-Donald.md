This is one of the least games I've played.

In Donald's Alphabet Chase, you play as Donald who's goal is to collect all the letters of the alphabet. You move around a room as letters pop up and dance around, and you move up and grab them to collect them. Once you collect all 26 letters, the game ends with an image of Donald looking like he just fucked all these letters and is enjoying the afterglow, while the alphabet song beeps out of your speaker.

This is barely a game. Like, even for the tiniest of babies, I dunno how effective this is at teaching them letters. It's just some jangly keys shit. We're ALMOST done with the Apple II games, by the way, we have two more coming up soon, though they're actually more games than the past two things I've played.
