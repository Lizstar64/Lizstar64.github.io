This is one of the first "Subsets" I've done in ages, or at least mastered. A subset is a bonus challenge set for a game, usually. So in this instance, I did not do the set for Pokemon Blue. Instead, I did a Professor Oak's challenge. What's Prof Oak's Challenge? It's simple. You need to get a maxed out Pokedex at every single instance you can, with gym badges as cutoffs.

So like, in Blue, you can't go past Pewter without defeating Brock, right? So you need to get every single Pokemon in the Pokedex logged before beating Brock. This means grinding your starter (in my case Bulbasaur) on Kakuna and Metapod for hours upon hours. And that's just the one Pokemon. A lot of them are way, way worse than that. Being able to split it up is nice though, and you're always working towards it and making progress.

I had Blue as a kid, and LOVED it. But I certainly never finished the Pokedex. This was my first time doing that, or at least, as complete as I can get it without trading. I didn't get all Eeveelutions or Gengar or the Red exclusives. Blue is the best one to do this in btw, specifically because Porygon is like 7500 coins in the game center, while in Red it's 9999. Which is agonizing. I just sold all my calciums and shit I found (cause I was grinding way above level anyway) to buy coins directly. I funded SO much Team Rocket shenanigans.

This is not very interesting. At all. Like, it's not meant to be. It's a grind. There's a LOT of grind subsets out there on RA. Things like "get all the rare 1/128 items in Earthbound", or "FF1 Solo Runs". A lot of RPGS make for good grinding achievements, but there's also stuff like the Shadow the Hedgehog all endings subset, which is a nightmare. I like grinds. It allows me to turn my brain off. It's a thing to work on without caring too much, always making some progress and relaxing as I watch something on Youtube or someone on Twitch.

This took me 25 hours and 33 minutes. According to the game, it took me 82 in-game hours. I was fast fowarding through most of it. Most people's least favorite part is from Misty to Koga, cause there's a LOT of Pokemon to catch and a lot of grinds. But honestly, it wasn't that bad? Like, most of those Pokemon can be grinded up as you do all the required stuff with Team Tocket, and/or caught as their evolved form. I had to grind evolve like, 8 Pokemon, which weren't THAT bad, and there's good spots for it. The worst part, IMO, was Brock to Misty, which required grinding on Diglett in Diglett Cave to get things up to like level 42. Even the Dragonite grind wasn't too bad. I think I just planned it well.

Would I recommend this? No, not really. But I'd consider doing another one lol
