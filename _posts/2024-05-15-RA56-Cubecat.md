Making a homebrew on the Sega Saturn is MASSIVELY impressive to me, no matter what it is.

This is Cubecat, specifically a version of it from like 2021 or 2022. This game is still being worked on and improved, but this version is more of a tech demo to show off the engine and whatnot. There are three levels of simple 3D platforming, and that's it, with achievements for beating each level, collecting all the collectables, speed running the levels, and most interestingly, playing with a fucked up FOV slider. Dynamic FOV sliders on the Saturn. Wowee.

You play as a cube cat who pounces and double jumps all through 3D platforms, to get to a big ball of yarn, which you then roll and bap back to the start of the level to win. Kinda like a weird Glover-like. It's cute, with cute jazzy music.

Like I said, ANY amount of homebrew on the Saturn makes me impressed, and I'm excited to see what else comes of this project in the future~
