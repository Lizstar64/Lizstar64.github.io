Yes, this IS a game. Kind of. So the 32X bombed like, real hard. Like a lot of bombed consoles, this resulted in a lot of games being cancelled. Most of the time we just get little hints at what could have been, screen shots in magazines, some developer explanations. But here, we get the full on prototype of a cancelled 32X game, Virtual Hamster! Its weird.

The only way to describe this, is you are a hamster on a hoverboard going through cyber tubes. Imagine the Sonic 2 halfpipe stages, it's BASICALLY that. You slide down along the sides cause of gravity, but can move all around if you get good momentum. There are enemies, though they don't seem to do anything, and there are powerups, they don't do anything either.

There's a big full map, which is just a tied up knot of tunnels. Sometimes a turn comes in the pipeway, and you'll go in the direction you're tilted, left or right. This makes it VERY confusing to know where the fuck you're going, but there IS a map, which helps. Though uh, helps for what? That's it. There's nothing else here.

Virtual Hamster is a weird game, a look into the hints of what game dev was like at the time, but even with that, I have no idea what this would be. Probably not super fun lol
