![A college professor gives a lecture. 'I wouldn't be surprised if you've had far more experience with that laugh than someone like me. For whatever reason... it seems like the world is divided into those who laugh, and those who are laughed at. Novels for girls are laughed at. Pop culture writers are laughed at. Love between girls is called immature. Stories about conservative modern housewives are laughed at. People going on about 'immature women'. Those who fancy themselves modern like to laugh. And those who can't become 'someone who laughs' end up getting laughed at.'](https://imgur.com/0up1Acc.png){: .center-block :}
