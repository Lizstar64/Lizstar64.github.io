One new staff member for this one, Lanila Baler, who's brought on for additional graphics staff. The office is quite packed. Also, I forgot to mention Joy Akebi joined for Avianos, which is wild cause she's one of my favorite members of staff, so I went back and fixed that.

So, LX Systems has made 13 games now, and uh, it's not going amazingly. They're losing money, and with having to hire more and more staff, it's catching up. They're trying to do more unconventional methods of advertisement, like with this game, where they put on a tournament at a local bar to drum up excitement. This bar, and the winner, are credited in this game. I like that idea, it's a cool idea, though I wish they had done it for a more interesting game. This is also one of the first games where Chiffon Bola took a more important role, as the lead gameplay designer, but like... it all kinda falls flat for me.

Bushido Ball is a sports game, the first true sports game of the company, and I don't really like those much, but they CAN be good. And this is clearly inspired by one of the best ones ever: Windjammers. The game is a pong-like sports game, where a ball is in the middle, and you control a person running around. You need to hit the ball with your weapon to try and get it past the opponent. After hitting the ball twice, you gain half a meter. This meter can be used for a special move by double tapping attack, or for a full charge hit by holding A, using up a whole meter bar.

It's also worth noting on top of VS, it also has co-op, to become a kind of doubles tennis game, which is neat, but I have no friends, so I can't experience it.

There's really not much more to it than that, to be honest. Like, there's no sound or music during the game, except for when a player wins a round, a little jingle plays. The art is really nice, and I like the different character designs. They're all varied, and have unique abilities that seem quite balanced. And like I said, Windjammers is king, but it's too slow and clunky compared to Windjammers, which is smooth and exciting and FUN. This is just a bit boring. It's not bad conceptually, but I just find I don't care about it, at all.

Sorry, Chiffon ):
