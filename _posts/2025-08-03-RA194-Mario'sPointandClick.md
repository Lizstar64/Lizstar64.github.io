This is one of the wildest things I've ever experienced. So, did you know the N64 had a mouse? It was made for the N64DD, and therefore has very little use, but it DOES exist. Well, someone took those protocols, and made a version of Mario 64 that uses mouse controls. Yes.

It's literally just Mario 64, entirely, with no changes. Except when you click someowhere, Mario moves there. When you right click, a menu pops up, and you can select from a long list of commands. Things like jump, long jump, attack, etc, as well as a variety of effects you can turn on and off, like wallkicks or crouching.

It DOES have one unique area added for the hack, a tutorial area designed to teach you the mechanics. But other than that, nothing is changed. And it's 100% completable. Not a single thing is impossible. You look at it, and immediately go "there's no way", but yes. Nothing is impossible. I did it all.

That's not to say it's easy. The slides are HELL, and any moving platform is the most evil thing on the planet, but you can overcome it. See, this hack turns Mario 64 from a 3D platformer collectathon to a puzzle game. And it's WEIRDLY fun? I replayed Mario 64 the other year for the first time in a while. It was.... fine. Not as good as people say, but also not as aged as others say. It's like, an 8/10, good game, but some of the later levels are so frustrating. But here? I had a WEIRDLY fun time trying to maneuver Tick Tock Clock. Playing it casually with normal controls, I was getting annoyed, but I died a BUNCH here and didn't care at all, just hopped back into it.

I really recommend this, it looks intimidating and very much a "what the fuck" kinda thing, but it was a LOT of fun.

Oh also, I made this set. I guess I should mention that. I was given this as a Kusogrande match and loved it so much I had to make the set and then beat it lmfao
