The year is 1983, only a few months after Barbuta was unleashed onto the world. Thorson Petters, the artist, was nearly fired for making the game on company time, but that's okay because he didn't really seem to like working at Business Soft anyway. I mean, with a name like that, who would? So he and two of his coworkers and friends, Gerry Smolski and Benedikt Chun, break away Business Soft to form LX Systems, a fledgling game company making games for the LX. The LX, like most micro computers, was never really intended for video games, the industry was still so extremely new. But companies like this began to pop up all over the place, and while LX Systems was not the most creative name for a company focused on making games on the LX, it would soon prove itself with its next, and technically first, release: Bug Hunter.

In Bug Hunter, you play as a mercenary exterminator hired by a moon quarry to stop bugs that have been running rampant. Can you stop the bugs before they overrun the mine? To assist you, the owners of the quarry will drop energy blocks on you, which can be used to upgrade your weapons.

The game is an extremely interesting strategy puzzle game. You have slots for seven actions. You start with very simple actions, run, jump, shoot, and lob. As you collect energy, you can spend it to change out your actions for a new action. This also refreshes the action, so if you have the energy, you can keep cashing out to do more and more things in one turn. Each turn, bugs and energy will spawn, and your goal is very simple. Kill the bugs. If a bug is not killed in a turn, it will evolve into a new form of bug. These bugs all have different abilities, some way worse than others. You've got bugs that make holes when they die, bugs that turn energy into anti-energy near them, bugs that explode when they die, bugs that create fodder and can't be killed unless you kill the fodder (the worst), bugs that take two hits (the OTHER worst). And after they evolve, then evolve again into scarier forms, they will become... take a guess... yep, that's right.

An egg. Oh, Petters.

And then if you can't kill the egg, it will hatch and you'll IMMEDIATELY lose. Eggs also don't count towards your kills, so it's best to not even let them get to that point. On top of needing 30 bug kills to win a round, you also need to finish in ten days. So an average of 3 bugs a day. Not too bad, right? Well, it can get pretty hectic, and it feels very RNG heavy. Some bug types feel like straight up run killers. It's probably easier in multiplayer, and it DOES have one of those though I haven't tested it, but the game is a real brain tickler. It also helps to remember you can mario stomp enemies by walking on them from heights, I kept forgetting that. Also, you can shoot energy to make it explode and kill enemies around it. But it can ALSO kill you, so be careful. For being a 1983 brain tickling puzzler, it's shockingly kind, because if you're targetting things, it'll show where an energy explosion will reach, including all the chain reactions. Very pleasant.

Overall, Bug Hunters is an interesting game, but not one I'd go back to every much. I got my 6 runs in a row for the cherry, and that was probably good for me. It has no music, and the graphics are primative, but pleasant enough. It feels weirdly isolating and uncomfortable, which hey, that fits. It also introduces Benedikt Chun and Gerry Smolski into the story as the other two co-founders of the company. Though they don't have a chance to really shine here, we'll learn more about them later.
