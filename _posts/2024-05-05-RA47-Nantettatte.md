I mastered two games today!

This one is a TG16 homebrew title by Aetherbyte. The game is free on their itch, and is essentially a free homebrew tech demo. It was a very simple set that literally took me 6 minutes and 5 seconds to master.

It starts with a "Winners Don't Do Drugs" 90s Arcade screen, but a parody making fun of some TG16 repro developer I'd never heard of, claiming they're overpriced and shitty. Yeah probably. The game is a shmup, where some cute anime girl named RomRom has been called to the future. In the future, the PCE Council sealed all the PCE games away, protecting them from a mighty volcano cataclysm. The other consoles were not so lucky, and now the armies of Nintendo and Sega are raiding the vault to try and destroy the games, out of jealousy and hatred. You need to stop the onslaught!

It's EXTREMELY simple. Basically a gallery shooter shmup. Fly your PC Engine along the bottom and shoot falling consoles. SNESs and Genesii explode into Famicoms and Master Systems, which can also be blown up. Giant Amiga Balls and tiny Game and Watches will fall down, and if they hit the bottom, will explode and kill you. Virtual Boys fly along the top of the screen like UFOs in Space Invaders, and will fire shots at you.

And... that's it! Extremely simple, like I said, more of a tech demo. Still, cute. Clearly made with a love for this console.
