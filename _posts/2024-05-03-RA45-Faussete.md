Game #45 is done, Fausette Amour for the PC-Engine CD! I'm doing lots of PC-Engine stuff this month, because of a website-wide event. So expect some PCE masteries comin' your way =w= This one took me about 4 and a half hours, and was mostly level-completion achievements, no-hit bosses, and a no-continues playthrough.

First is THIS... exciting experience. This is Fausette Amour, which if you can speak French, you'll realize is extremely improper French. My friend Zandra came into stream and flinched a bunch at it lol. It's a game released only in Japan, and it's CLEARLY a knock off of the Valis games. Or, y'know, heavily inspired. The best way for me to describe it is it's Valis meets Castlevania meets Bionic Commando meets uh... Ghosts n' Goblins, mostly cause when you take a hit your clothes fly off, and you get two hits.

Story? I dunno, in Japanese. Fight a bunch of demons who are actually women, save your sister, stop a demon with big goat titties. This game is VERY tantalizing. Lots of tits and ass. Almost every one of the cutscenes involves your character, who's name is Cork Lance btw, amazing name, standing in a bad ass action pose, with the camera focused REALLY CLOSE up on her ass, or thong. It's a little much.

The gameplay is pretty jank, but honestly, the game itself is really not that bad. It's a pretty hard game, but I'd give it a 6/10. Worth playing, maybe. But maybe just stick to Valis.
