So I kinda like the idea of just, focusing on a console and playing a bunch of random games from that console. It's a fun thing, gives you a snapshot into it. Plus, playing all the obscure random shit you can find in a console helps you find some real gems!

The PC88 is different. I was looking through the library on RA, trying to find things to play. Most of them are porn. Some of them are very bad porn, like 177. This is at least better than that. It's just boring and bad.

Joshi Daisei Private, or Private Stripper, is a very simple sliding puzzle game from 1983 by Nihon Falcom. Yes, that Falcom. Before they made Ys, or Brandish, or Xanadu, or Popful Mail, or even Dragon Slayer, they made this. How does it work? Okay, you start the game, then select K for Kyoko, M for Miyuki, or Y for Yuko. Then you select Quadratic or Cubic. And then, depending on the girl you selected, you do three puzzles, sliding them in place as they get more risque, going from pinups to showing tits. Ooh, scandalous. The art is pretty bad, I'mma be real. Like they don't have very many colors to show off, but it's still pretty hideous.

In Cubic mode, all of the squares are there, and you slide an entire row or column along to slide things into the right spots. In Quadratic type, one of the tiles is missing, and you can only slide tiles into that spot. Someone in the comments said that quadratic type puzzles can be literally impossible, but that didn't happen for me and I dunno how that'd happen. Either way, that's just a traditional sliding puzzle alright!!

There's really not much more to say. This is a VERY weird footnote in the storied history of Falcom, alright.
