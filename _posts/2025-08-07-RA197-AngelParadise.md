So a while ago I played a smut game for the Saturn where you play rock paper scissors to see videos of women stripping. I expected this to be like that but it's actually not, at all. I can't find a lot of information on this. Shockingly, it and games like it are not very popular when you can just look up pictures of beautiful women easily these days, but here's what I gather.

This game is a collection of videos and gifs of beautiful women doing things. You have two modes of play, depending on the level: you have a sliding puzzle, and you have a jigsaw puzzle. All the pieces to these puzzles are animated video, which makes it much harder to solve, but adds an interesting little dimensionality to a puzzle.

The sliding puzzle is kinda easy to understand so I'll explain the jigsaw, because it is not. Honetly, I mastered this game and it still makes little sense to me. The concept is simple: you have the pieces on the right, you click and drag them where they belong. They have different shapes to help you narrow down where the piece could go.

When you place the piece, however, it seems to... weaken? The spots around it? And you can use this to kinda clear entire sections and lines. If you manage to do this properly, and in the correct spot, you'll get a bonus item that unlocks a bonus video. You could also get bonus items that help you in puzzles, like stopping the image or giving you more time. I never found the puzzle so difficult that it'd take me more than two tries, though.

The thing that surprised me about this game is that it's not very pervy. Like, at all. It's listed as mature and I expected porn, but it's not. It's just videos of women... a woman? I can't tell honestly cause I have face blindness, but I think it's multiple women, doing random things. Riding a bike. Playing on a beach. Rollerskating. It's much more innocent. I cannot find information on any women who are in this, so my guess is it's idol shit? Idol culture is weirdly chaste at times.

Anyways, it's a weird little curiosity, but not much more. There WAS a volume 2, which I played, but it's ONLY the Jigsaw puzzles, no sliding puzzles. And honestly? I prefer the sliding puzzles. So I was uninterested.
