So way back in the 90s, as computers and consoles were getting better with Chess AI, there was a game called Battle Chess. It was basically just Chess, but any time a piece was taken, there was a little animation between the pieces where they fought. It was a cute little thing, though its pacing was a little off. Sometimes you just wanna play Chess, honestly, and watching a little animation with EVERY piece being taken takes a lot of time.

But it was still a popular idea, so they took that and brought it to Star Wars! Star Wars was always really, really big, and it sure was in the early 90s. Enter Star Wars Chess, or "The Software Toolworks Star Wars Chess" which rolls right off the fuckin' tongue. It's literally just what I said earlier.

You've got some fun animations here. My favorite is Yoda, the light side rook, being killed by Boba Fett, the dark side bishops, because boba fett melts Yoda and Yoda kinda becomes one of those green blobs Calvin would eat in Calvin and Hobbes. But yeah, it's chess other than that. And I DO like chess. The AI here is fine. Can only think a few moves ahead, not too hard to beat, even on the hardest difficulties. Don't got much more to say than that. If you ever wanted to watch Chewie get brutally murdered, this is the game for you!
