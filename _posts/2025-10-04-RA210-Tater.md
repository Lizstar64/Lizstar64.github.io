So the other day I reviewed Kwirk, which is a cute little Gameboy puzzle game. This is the sequel to that. You might think that means that means its pretty similar. You'd be correct!

Amazing Tater, also known as Puzzle Boy 2 in Japan (frankly, I think both names are bad), plays almost exactly like Kwirk. You push blocks around, push em into holes, and move around spinners which can be blocked. Move to a goal. It's frankly a simple and fun little puzzle game. All new puzzles, go give it a whirl, not much more to say, right?

Well, there IS one new mechanic. In some levels, you have multiple characters! There's a, like, collection of characters made for this game. Kwirk himself is nowhere to be seen. And sometimes, multiple are in a level at once. You can swap between them with select, which honestly is a fun addition to sokoban that increases the complexity by quite a lot.

The other new addition is a race mode, of sorts. It's a little weird. You have two versions of it, one where it's a race, and one where you're lost in the woods. You get a random selection of puzzles, and you need to solve them. If you solve them fast with no resets, you continue onwards with the race. If you fuck up too much, you fall back in place, or get more lost. It's a weird system, but I kinda get what they were going for.

All in all, this really is just more Kwirk. If you like that kinda game, then you'll like this. Not much more to it.
