Inventory Full is a homebrew Gameboy game by megamittz, and you can find it on itch.io for free. IT was made in GB Studio, the usual go-to for Gameboy homebrew these days. It's a short little game, prolly about 6 to 7 minutes. The plot is that you're the leader of a group who just explored a dungeon and found the legendary sword at the end, but your inventories are full, so you take your comrade's equipment and sell it on Ebay.

The rest of the game is a very simple actiony arcade game, where you try and sneak past your allies to grab their stuff. They're blocking your way, as well as other hazards, and you need to move left and right, then press A to charge forward. Three hits and you're out. It's not very complex, but the art is very nice and cute, with big full cutscene art that's pleasant.

This isn't anything special, but I like checking out homebrew now and then, there's a lot of great homebrew on the Gameboy and the NES.
