I am a huge fan of block stackers and the like, and this is a real classic. Well not THIS one, but this one. Magical Drop is a venerable series, and there were a lot of games in the series. But the big one that everyone agrees is the best, Magical Drop 3, does not have a set for some reason. So I did Magical Drop Pocket instead, for the Neo Geo Pocket Color.

It's basically just Magical Drop 3, but on a handheld lol

Press one button to pick up a block, then press the other to drop it down. You can pick up stacks of the same color. Match 3 or more. Do it fast to send junk over to your opponent. EZ PZ, very simple. This version doesn't have a wide enough screen, or enough processing power to show two fields at once, so just uh, pretend you're fighting someone, who's face is in the top right mocking you. Basically, do it fast enough to fill up that yellow bar lol

In order to master this set, I had to beat this game 11 times, as well as beating it on the 5 different difficulty settings, and without using continues for one of those wins. It really wasn't that hard lol. Like, beating this game 11 times in ONE SITTING is hard, but mostly cause it'll fucking destroy your hands. This is a HIGH OCTANE game, and I'm actually kinda cracked at it, but it's a LOT. The last few achievements are for surviving in the survival mode for a while, the last of which took me a bit. I actually did most of this set two months ago, but got stuck on surviving in the very hard difficulty for 50 levels. Finally got it again today after picking it back up.

This'd be a pretty good handheld version of Magical Drop for back in the day, tbh. Still, I want them to make a set for Magical Drop 3. Maybe I will, once I become a full fledged developer lol. Also, might do the set for Magical Drop 2 on SNES sometime soon.
