Look, every console needs one of these, okay? And sometimes it's fun to play some Othello.

This is Othello for the Apple II. There's really not much more to say than that. You choose a difficulty from 1-3, I couldn't tell a difference, and then if you wanna start as white or black, and you're off. I don't believe there's a way to play against people. You take turns putting tiles of your color down. You can only place tiles if you're next to an opponent's tile, and there's a line through your opponent's tiles to one of your own. When you do, all those opponent's tiles flip to your tile, and the game continues. You play until all spaces are filled, and whoever has the most tiles wins.

Othello is a simple but fun board game. It's got that Chess energy of a 1v1 board game you can play on the computer but with much easier AI to program so they could actually make it for old computers. Your goal should always be to get the corners and walls, those are the most powerful spaces. Especially the corners, they can never be turned, get them at ALL COSTS.

Othello is fine, and this is a fine enough version of it for... wait shit, this came out in 1979?! Holy moly. Alright, fair.
