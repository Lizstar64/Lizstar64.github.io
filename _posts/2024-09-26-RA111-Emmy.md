Continuing my PC88 kick, it's about time I got to some porn. There is a LOT of porn on this computer. Technically two of my PC88 games I've done so far have already been porn, but they're also like, games. One was a QIX clone with porn, and the other was a sliding tile puzzle. This game has literally no purpose other than to get a girl to take her clothes off. This is Emmy.

We should start by talking about ELIZA, a program from 1966. It was the first attempt by someone to make a program with a text parser that would respond to you based on the things you say. It was less a game and more a turing test. This follows a similar idea, though its text parser is actually more simple. ELIZA in its most famous iterations acted like a therapist, and would call back to previous things you said. Emmy will take her clothes off if you do nothing but praise her over and over.

That's not to say it makes much sense! Here's the plan: You call her cute, then introduce yourself with a simple hello and give your name. After that, repeat shit like "kimi ha suteki", "kimi no me ha kirei", "kawai ne". Don't repeat it TOO much, have a long list of things to say, because she'll get annoyed if you say the same thing over and over. But it really is just that. You can also ask her things about herself, get a little dirty, but she'll just giggle and not give much. If you annoy her too much she will literally show you the door, getting more and more grumpy.

For an example of what you could call an EXTREMELY early dating sim, it's very interesting! And I like the art a lot, actually. It's expressive, and I love her green hair. Like, it's not hot. At all. But if I find a single hot PC88 game I'll be *stunned*.

It was apparently kinda popular in Japan, there are a bunch of versions of it, and was inspirational. Apparently Emmies got put into games for a bit, as a reference. That's kinda neat.
