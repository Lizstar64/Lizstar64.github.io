Man, remember when Portal was the only thing that mattered? This is actually from a bit beyond that. This is a homebrew from 2016 by Ashley Samuelson, and is probably just a personal project thing. Yep, it's yet another Homebrew game. I sometimes like to check these out because they're often really short and easy, and sometimes you find some interesting stuff with them!

I don't really have much to comment on here, though. You play as a Companion Cube that can slide around and jump. You eventually obtain your own portal gun, but there are only like 10-15 screens. It's really more of a beta than anything else. There's no music or sound effects, probably because the GBA's sound setup is hell on earth. None of the screens are super complex, because it's 2D, so you don't get any of the wild puzzle setups you could get in the original Portal, or especially Portal 2.

It's a cute little thing for like 10 minutes, though.
