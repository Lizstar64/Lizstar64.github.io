I apparently never moved my Link's Awakening review over here. God, what do I say about Link's Awakening? Well, it's my all time favorite  Zelda game, which means it's one of my favorite games ever. I replay it once every few years. I own like six copies for some reason. It's utter Zelda perfection.

Coming out in the middle of the Gameboy's life-cycle, it got a port to the Gameboy Color six years later. It's pretty similar, with only a few minor changes, and is more of the same. I mastered the original last year, and put this one off cause some of the challenges annoyed me.

This set has a lot of missables. No hit challenges, don't do this in this order, etc etc. I actually had to play this game through twice to do this because it glitched out. If you kill like 80 enemies in a row or something (I was trying to farm for acorns, forgetting how that worked) it will change your tunic color, and might glitch out other things. It gave me a photograph and I couldn't get the achievement for getting that photograph later. Oops!

Link's Awakening started as a remake of LTTP, but I'm so glad it became this in the end. It's a weird, unique Zelda game. Lots of things that are just... It. And the story! Oh man. I think it's fitting that my two favorite  Zeldas are Majora's Mask and this, the two games with the most melancholy and sad stories.

I don't think I need to go into a full deep dive of Link's Awakening. All I need to tell you is that it's fantastic, and this is a good version. Not DEFINITIVE. It adds an additional dungeon, which is an okay dungeon, and the photos system, which is cute.

If you've never played Link's Awakening, I highly recommend it. It's not too long compared to other Zelda games, but it's a solid thing for a Gameboy title. Do yourself a favor and check it out.
