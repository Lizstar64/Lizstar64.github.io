The first game I played this year was a random-ass Gameboy game no one's ever heard of. Not even I had heard of this game before I played it. I was looking at Tryrush Deppy, one of my sets I made for Saturn, and saw someone added this game as a game that's like it. Well shit! Tryrush Deppy can be a little frustrating at times, but I DO like it, lemme try this out! Guess what. This was ALSO frustrating at times. Minus the little.

Banishing Racer is essentially Opposite Tryrush Deppy. It was made by Jaleco, a company I've had mixed results with. You play as a car in a race across America, (driven by an angel who brings him back to life from the dump, which is wild) but instead of going from NYC to Sanfran, you go from Sanfran to NYC. Each of the levels is based off of where you are in the map. This means you get hilarious levels like the cow farm in the middle of the country, or a car factory near Detroit.

It's a platformer. You can jump, and charge. Your charge is a bit dinky, but it's a good idea to learn how to charge jump, or charge in midair for tricky platforming. You can ONLY charge forward, so moving backwards can be dangerous. And that's it. Platform your way across America, hopping on cars and shit. If you hop on like 6 cars in a row, you get a 1-up, which trust me, is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. The final levels in this game are fucked beyond belief. There's a 3 minute long auto scroller with no checkpoints, and a lot of trial and error. It was MASSIVELY rude.

In the end, Banishing Racer is.... fine. But it's not really a forgotten gem. It's a little too mean for its own good, and its conceit and platforming is FINE but not breathtaking. It's like a 6/10.
