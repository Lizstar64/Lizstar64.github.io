Took about 30 hours of gameplay, apparently.

The 44th game I've 100%'d on Retro Achievements, this is one of my favorite games of all time, one I'm SUPER into, and have wanted to do since starting RA. But it's very intimidating. I'd never 100%'d PDS before, and uh, after doing it... I'm glad I did! But I'm probably not doing this again.

It was the most stressful mastery I've done, because 95% of this game is missable content, and you might find out 20 hours later that you missed something you can't go back to from 3 hours into the game. I had a lot of backup saves set up to make sure I didn't screw anything up. And I didn't! I made it through with no problems! If you don't know what 100% entails, imagine Castlevania's 100% Map Hunting... But in 3D, on a dragon. And a lot of the map chunks are tiny slivers in a wall that you can barely see. But the game tracks it, so you gotta do it lol and it GRADES you at the end.

If you've not played this game, I won't spoil anything, but it comes 200% recommended. Also I already did a review of it. One of the best RPGs of all time, and thus one of the best GAMES of all time, an absolute 10/10, I can replay this game every year or so happily. A fantastic time.
