!["But what do you like about me? Everyone says I'm like an old man...""I like everything about you. I like the sloppy way you get drunk and throw your clothes around the room. I like the way you chug energy drinks. I like how you eat really garlicky foods in the office." "WHY ARE THOSE THE THINGS YOU LIKE?! Why do you have such bizzarre taste?!"](https://imgur.com/4qLNfiq.png){: .center-block :}

A girl for a boyfriend?! What will they think of next?

Maybe we should name this concept!

Maybe something like a girlboyfriend.
