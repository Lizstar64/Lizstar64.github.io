<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p><strong>Sacrifice of Angels</strong> - DS9
8/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/gQkHIj5.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>Tensions are high. In eight hours those mines are going down, and while Sisko is surviving, it’s just barely. So the rebels on DS9 need to do something, and fast. What’s their plan? A bomb. Too bad Damar arrests all of them on suspicions of them being rebels, which I mean, they are. So now it’s all on the last member of the resistance who ISN’T detained. And that’s Quark.</p>

<p>It’s literally all on Quark. We’re fucked.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/10EwmIN.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>Dukat is cocky. He knows what he’s doing, and he knows he’s going to win. What… IS he doing, anyway? He and Damar are like “once this war is done we’ll break off from the Dominion~” Uh fucking how? How do you EVER expect that of happening??? Cardassia’s best opportunity was siding with the Federation, and they betrayed them instead. Anyways Dukat is an absolute trashfire of a person, and there’s a good scene with him and Weyoun showing the differences between him/Cardassia and the rest of the Dominion. Weyoun is like “Welp, we’ll have to genocide everyone on Earth once we conquer the Federation, because they can’t be controlled” and Dukat is like “why would we do that??? What’s the point of fascism if people can’t see you do it? The point is the GLOATING and powering OVER people!”</p>

<p>Odo is still bimbo-pilled by the female Changeling, but she just lets it slip that Kira is being executed because they’ll trump up charges even though they can’t find anything. Welp. Good job losing the easily won war with ONE thing cause you’rE SO sure of your bimbofication process.</p>

<p>Quark saves the day, with the help of Dukat’s daughter. In the process, Quark kills some guards, almost certainly the first person he’s EVER killed.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/uYjqb4K.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>Odo breaks free of Bimbofication. “The link is paradise, but I’m not ready for paradise”. He and his guards blast away the people chasing Kira and the others, and they’re on their way to sabatoge the station. In the end though, they’re just SECONDS too late. The mines are taken down. Sisko goes into the wormhole, to meet the thousands of Dominion ships. Because of Kira, they can’t blow him up as his ship goes in.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/TEQYPKT.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>The Sisko argues with the aliens, who are like “You are about to kill yourself trying to fight these forces.” and Sisko is like “I am :)” so they just…. hold the Dominion ships. They just Get Rid Of Them. It’s basically a deus ex machina. The Dominion is strong, but the Wormhole Aliens are BASICALLY gods. As compared to the Changelings, who just ACT like they’re gods.</p>

<p>Welp, the Dominion are fucked. They immediately schedule a retreat, cause the Klingons are bolstering the Federation. Gul Dukat is SHAKEN, and wanders the halls looking for Ziyal. When she tells him “I’m not leaving, also I helped the resistance”, he’s broken even more, and THEN Damar fucking shoots her, cause she’s a traitor. Damar you FUCKING IDIOT. This COMPLETELY SHATTERS Dukat, who straight up goes insane. He can’t comprehend that Ziyal is dead and he lost and he’s also part of the reason. He just rambles about forgiving her, and forgiving Sisko.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/rLkIkp6.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>It was a hard fought battle, but we did it. ALMOST a phyrric victory. So much of the fleet was lost. But we have the key to the Alpha Quadrant. There are cheers, and cries, and hugs. We did it.</p>

<p><strong>You are Cordially Invited</strong> - DS9
4/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/zQFRAOm.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>Things are going well on DS9 now that it’s back under the Federation. Alexander is about to be transfered away though, so Worf and Dax’s wedding is pushed up to happen on DS9, so he can be there for it. How sweet. This episode then splits into two things. 1) Worf, Martok, Sisko, Alexander, O’Brien, and Bashir are doing a goofy Klingon-ass bachelor party. And 2) Dax is being judged by Martok’s wife to see if she is worthy to enter the house. She’s a xenophobic rich bitch asshole, and Martok is FUCKING TERRIFIED of her, which is very funny.</p>

<p>This episode also has one of my absolute favorite quotes in the entire show. “You’ve gained weight. And your hair is growing grey.” “My… deterioration is proceeding apace.”</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/BbNQLOF.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>God Dax is hot. Worf doesn’t deserve her. Worf is actually pretty good here, I kind of hate DS9 Worf, but this is feeling more TNG-ish. Like he’s like “Y’all are being xenophobic, that is stupid.” Dax is EXTREMELY defiant of this woman. It’s hot as fuck. It eventually ends with her calling the entire wedding off, which she has the power to do cause Klingon tradition is dumb. Worf tells her to beg, and she’s like “what? No, she’s a fucking xenophobic asshole, I won’t do that”, so WORF calls off the god damn wedding too, like “she was right about you”</p>

<p>NO. NO YOU IDIOT. AND THEN WHEN THEY CONVINCE WORF, AND SHE’S STILL MAD, THERE’S SOME DUMB SHIT WHERE ONCE SISKO TALKS TO HER, DAX IS LIKE “guess I gotta grow you”. NO. NO, HE IS NOT GOOD FOR YOU, AND WANTS YOU TO PUT UP WITH PEOPLE TREATING YOU LIKE SHIT. They do the whole “groveling to enter the house” thing off screen, I guess the mother in law just allows it now. This episode has some fun moments but in the end, I do not like Worf x Dax because I can’t stand DS9 Worf, and this is a good example of why.</p>

<p>At least it has this moment, one of my favorites.</p>

<p><strong>Resurrection</strong> - DS9
6.5/10</p>

<p>&lt;img src=”https://imgur.com/8cYbe65.png” alt=”trek”</p>

<p>Dax and Kira are having a conversation about how Kira needs to get laid basically, she hasn’t dated anyone in months. She’s fine with it, but Dax is shovy. Dax if you want her to date someone that bad, divorce Worf and date her. Please. Please do that. For the love of God, please. Unfortunately no. Instead, we get someone beaming into Ops. It’s MIRROR UNIVERSE VEDEK BAREIL! You remember him? He was the failed pope boy who died because his brain was turned into a cyborg or some shit. I never cared about him much.</p>

<p>This Bariel starts his existence in our story by holding Kira hostage with a broken gun, and begging to be allowed to stay in the prime universe, because the mirror universe is fucking garbage and who’d wanna live there? He seems like he’s trying to just… become a part of it, now, once he realizes how much better it is. He goes to church, though feels weird that his counterpart here was nearly pope and well respected, cause he’s a thief who is NOT respected. He’s basically a han solo-esque thief. Very different from our Bareil.</p>

<p>&lt;img src=”https://imgur.com/bHuGjXi.png” alt=”trek”</p>

<p>Obviously the two of them start getting into it. Kira says it’s not cause he looks like Bareil. He’s nothing LIKE him. But it’s cause he’s who he is. I dunno if I believe that lol. Bareil goes and has an Orb Experience, which is what it’s called, and we’ve been making fun of that phrase a LOT. He has his Orb Experience and it seems to be bothering him, but you’re Not Allowed To Talk About Your Orb Experience.</p>

<p>&lt;img src=”https://imgur.com/uHAHmTj.png” alt=”trek”</p>

<p>Anyways, hot sexy bisexual Kira is here. Turns out it’s all a ruse. He’s here to steal the Orb. He seems conflicted though. Seems his Orb Experience, and making out with the Major, and ALSO everyone thinking he’s Vedek Bareil is getting to him. It’s funny how Kira catches on to this. It’s not cause he slips up, or anything. It’s cause QUARK sees him for what he is, and flat out warns Kira. “He’s gonna rob the orb”. Quark sees RIGHT through him.</p>

<p>&lt;img src=”https://imgur.com/EdkxsC4.png” alt=”trek”</p>

<p>Once again, Quark saving the day. There’s a standoff with Bareil, Kira, and Kira, and Bareil shoots Kira and then wishes Kira well. He saw them being happy and in love in the orb, but he knew, he’d fuck it up some day. Might as well fuck it up now. And then it ends. This episode was fine.</p>

<p><strong>Statistical Probabilities</strong> - DS9
2/10</p>

<p>&lt;img src=”https://imgur.com/8cYbe65.png” alt=”trek”</p>

<p>So, people who have been genetically enhanced in the Federation, against their will specifically, are sent to an institute. What that implies isn’t explained yet, we just know that at the start of this. There are four genetically enhanced individuals, and treatments by the therapists and psychologists there aren’t working. Why they’d NEED them again, isn’t explained. These people are supposed to be genetically enhanced, instead they’re introduced and shown as if they have mental disorders. You’ve got the one who won’t talk, the anxious wreck, the overly sexual nympho, and the manic violent one. They’re trying something new to treat them and make them “valued members of society”, by having Bashir work with them. Bashir, also being genetically enhanced, can maybe find common ground. Bashir explains later that the REASON they’re all like this is because the enhancement failed, in a way, and caused unintended side effects.</p>

<p>So I see what they’re TRYING to do. Y’know, saying things using this world to say things about OUR world. In this case, they’re using the genetically enhanced to talk about how we, as a society, treat people with mental disorders. First, I want to state I am not qualified to talk about this. I’m neuroatypical, myself, but like, I NEVER feel comfortable talking about something so broad. But this makes me VERY uncomfortable. The violence is uncomfy. And also there’s a thing here like, ascribing almost supernatural abilities to being neuroatypical. Like, it’s nothing built of malice. It’s built from liberal ignorance.</p>

<p>&lt;img src=”https://imgur.com/pKCZTlL.png” alt=”trek”</p>

<p>ANYWAYS there’s plot. Damar is the new leader. He’s also Gul Damar, even though Guls are just planetary governors and not dictators, but Dukat kept Gul to appear humble so I guess Damar does too. The Dominion is looking for peace treaties, and are willing to give over a lot of land for that reason. The Neurosis Squad looks over the proceedings using a computer, scanning them, and use their Big Meaty Superbrains to determine what the dominion REALLY wants. They can also just tell what O’Brien is thinking by looking at him. They’re trying to go with a “they’re very analytical” but instead they’re just, psychic. And they can apparently use these powers to be able to read the future. Okay, whatever.</p>

<p>One thing I kinda like about this is that Bashir is VERY unhappy with the idea of being considered “one of the good ones”, and that’s fair. That’s a good, solid topic to talk about. It doesn’t handle it PERFECTLY, cause it handles nothing perfectly. But it’s an important topic, and it handles it… okay.</p>

<p>&lt;img src=”https://imgur.com/ao8S0FJ.png” alt=”trek”</p>

<p>This episode gets very off the rails in a way I don’t like where they use their Future Calculations to determine that the Federation has absolutely zero hopes of winning this war, so it’s either surrender and save people, we just have to put up with fascism, or keep fighting and 900 billion people will die.</p>

<p>Anyways I hate how Bashir is here, a lot. It gets even MORE off the rails when the Super Brains determine that they can just send Federation secrets to the Dominion, who’d then win the war in weeks, and only two billion would die. MUCH better! Time to go betray the Federation! After all, we’re gods who can determine this!! They knock Bashir out and leave him with the mute one. She lets him go, because she likes the violent one, I guess, and Bashir convinces her that this will ruin her chances with him or some shit???</p>

<p>&lt;img src=”https://imgur.com/XqcbIrK.png” alt=”trek”</p>

<p>Anyways, Jack didn’t anticipate that, and yes, that’s the point of this. One person derailed their plans, so you can’t just guess the future using algorithms. AND YES. DUH. OF COURSE. OBVIOUSLY. WHY WAS THIS EVEN THE QUESTION?</p>

<p>Anyways this episode sucks and I kind of hate it. But I don’t really wanna go into it too much cause again, it’s a topic I’m uncomfortable even talking about.</p>

<p><strong>Statistical Probabilities</strong> - DS9
9/10</p>

<p>&lt;img src=”https://imgur.com/iN39qZW.png” alt=”trek”</p>

<p>The episode starts with Quark being his Quarky self, when he gets some bad news from the Nagus. Moogie has been kidnapped by the Dominion. Why would she be kidnapped? Not like Ferenginar is allied with the Klingons or the Federation. Who knows, doesn’t matter. What matters is Quark needs to rescue her, and he needs to put together a crackpot team of the galaxy’s best Ferengi. We’ve got Nog, obviously, his Moogie is captured. We’ve also got Rom, who is talked into it easily by being told he’ll be given Worf’s job on Quark’s ship, basically. We’ve also got a very weird Ferengi, his name is Leck. He’s an “Eliminator”, who doesn’t care about latinum, but is VERY excited to possibly kill some Dominion. And finally, Quark pays his cousin Gaila’s bail, to get him out of jail to help out. And as they’re all bickering and arguing, Ex-Liquidator Brunt shows up and offers to help, cause it might help him get his job back. No one likes him, but he has a ship, so…</p>

<p>And thus we have our team. A bartender, an outcast, a psychopath, a failed weapons dealer, a failed traitor, and the smartest man in the Alpha Quadrant that isn’t Chief O’Brien. But even Rom being with them isn’t going to help. All of their training is not working out. Leck keeps shooting Moogie after everyone else runs away, cause hey, putting her out of her misery. But Rom, again being one of the smartest people in the Quadrant, says they’re playing to their weaknesses. Time to play to their strengths. They put in some favors with the Federation to get Keevan, the Vorta who was captured a few episodes ago, to trade. And they meet up on Empek Nor, the DS9 clone. Cool!</p>

<p>&lt;img src=”https://imgur.com/88mshWk.png” alt=”trek”</p>

<p>This episode is VERY goofy and stupid, because the Ferengi are goofy and stupid, but in a great way.</p>

<p>&lt;img src=”https://imgur.com/oxi6UAw.png” alt=”trek”</p>

<p>The talks begin. It’s very Magnificent Seven, because the Ferengi all studied the movie before shooting lol. We’ve got the Vorta they’re dealing with, played by Iggy Pop, and he is dry and flat and I LOVE him. He’s VERY funny. Everything seems to be going well, actually! They make some good deals, and plan to exchange prisoners in a half hour. Unfortunately, Rom lets loose that the others aren’t getting a fair share of the payment, aaaaand shots are fires. Keevan is killed, and his last words are “I hate Ferengi”.</p>

<p>With no prisoner, what else can we do? We have one last plan…. use cortical stimulators to weekend at bernies Keevan.</p>

<p>That’s right. This is Magificent Seven meets Weekend at Bernies.</p>

<p>It’s tense, it’s a very tense situation, but they make it out, and get the element of surprise. Leck gets to kill his Jem’Hadar, which he’s VERY excited about, and they capture Iggy Pop to give to the Federation as a gift. And they leave, happily, as Keevans’ corpse walks into a wall over and over. You can actually see the actors laughing, barely able to hold themselves together as they watch him. Armin Shimmerman was having a blast, which always helps me like an episode more.</p>

<p>This episode is VERY funny, extremely enjoyable.</p>

<p>….Next week we’re gonna do DS9 to get a cycle going correctly, and TOTALLY not because next week has several Episodes Of All Time.</p>
