<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p>This is the third season of SNW, finally coming out. We’re gonna watch an episode of this once a week until we finish, alongside Voyager, cause it’s coming out y’know, one a week. Yay! I love SNW!</p>

<p><strong>Through the Lens of Time</strong> - SNW
5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/N8mQara.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>This season is going really hard on the romance drama, which is starting to get mostly tiring for me. But it’s ALSO pushing this new nurse guy, Dana. He’s SO excited and happy to be here. This guy is SO fucking dead. He’s got the voice over and it’s really pushing him, he’s so fucked. It also seems like he was brought in secretly as a third wheel so that thigns aren’t TOO awkward between Spock and Korby as they do some kind of dig.</p>

<p>Ortegas’ brother is also here! He’s recording stuff for a documentary, it seems, and is also invited to this mission, which SEEMS to be an archaeological dig on a sacred site. He’s also getting romance vibes with Uhura. They’re really trying to hook EVERYONE up this season aren’t they? Though Pelia the Warpcore Witch also seems to be real into him. And I like that, cause it’s funny.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/p5JfYBa.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>They all enter some kind of temple, after Chapel does some kind of thing to gain entry. They IMMEDIATELY find corpses and Spock is like “okay, protocol tells is we need to leave now”. Korby gets pissy and refuses, and Chapel, who’s in charge of the mission, sides with him cause he’s her girlfriend. There’s also a lot of tension cause of the whole Spock x Chapel thing. See, this is why everyone shouldn’t just fuck. Use the holodeck to fuck- wait. We already had an episode about how that’s a bad idea at this time.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ypNSSmn.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>New Kid, who’s name is Gamble, acts like a TOS red shirt and randomly touches shit. Anyways, woah, New Kid gets his fucking eyes exploded cause things are actually super dangerous in here! Looks like Spock was right, what a mother fucking shock! The native living with them sees something else, freaks the fuck out, and tries to run away, and is vaporized. But we have so many things we could learn here!!! Korby was ABSOLUTELY going to just fucking die because he wasn’t being careful enough if others didn’t die before him, frankly. Why was he SO SURE that he had to do this dig RIGHT THE FUCK NOW? “I’ve waited all my life for this!” Yeah dude, but you’re like, 33. This temple isn’t going anywhere. Put down that fucking idiot ball, right now, mister!</p>

<p>They get split up, as if it couldnt’ get any worse, and are in different rooms, but able to communicate. This now turns into a split room puzzle game escape room. Seems to be the same room but also not, seperate dimensions. They can still communicate though. Why? I dunno, bad writing?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/x4jYCCp.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>The Eyeball Regenerator, which apparently exists, is not working. New Kid’s brain is also registering as braindead. New episode name: Gamble’s Brain. Gamble is also acting Kinda Sus now. Hmm.</p>

<p>Ten minutes ago, Gamble’s eyes exploded. Now, Spock is saying how Korby is not being safe enough and not taking any precautions, and then he TAKES A FUCKING VISOR OFF OF A DEAD ALIEN AND PUTS IT ON HIS EYEBALLS AND USES IT TO LOOK AT THINGS. WHAT THE FUCK, SPOCK? I’m starting to think this episode might just not be well written.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/HLyV7Ze.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>Patel, who I remind you is now half Gorn, meets Gamble, and starts speaking in tongues. Gamble does the same, and they proceed to beat the shit out of each other. Gamble also murders someone in the scuffle. After he’s captured, he just breaks through the force fields and kills more red shirts. Damn, this episode has a body count.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/hp0x8tF.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>Pelia shoots Gamble in the back, releasing the ancient dimensional alien inside of him. Scotty then captures it in a Pokeball and tosses it up into the transporter. He locks it in the transport buffer, until they can figure out what to do with it. There’s no WAY that’ll backfire!!!</p>

<p>Pelia has a big discussion about ancient evil, which turns out to be her mugging for the documentary. Okay, that was funny. I was like “wow that’s very on the nose- oh okay, that’s good”. I do like Pelia. As M’Benga calls Gamble’s parents to tell them about their son, the Enterprise computer screens flash alien text. Wow, I knew it’d backfire but THAT fast.</p>

<p>I think my judgement of this will depend on if and when it goes anywhere, but I feel it was poorly written. Something was off and the pacing was bad.</p>

<p><strong>The Sehlat Who Ate Its Tail</strong> - SNW
8/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/iXkfagX.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>What a weird episode title.</p>

<p>Anyways, Kirk is on the Ferragut, and he’s bored as fuck. His captain, V’rel is a hot Vulcan bitch who does everything By The Book, and Kirk wants a shakeup. Be careful what you wish for, Kirk. They disturb a disturbance in the crust of a planet they’re observing, which turns out to be the planet fucking exploding. The captain and a lot of the crew is taken out. Comms are down, so there’s no way to communicate.</p>

<p>Enterprise comes to help out, a team beaming over to try and help. Kirk is in charge, V’Rel is alive but injured. Turns out there was some kind of gravitational beam that blew up the planet, though it’d take a ship so much larger than anything else on record. Uhura sets up comms with the Enterprise, who orders everyone to evacuate. Fair. La’an and some of the critically wounded beam over first. Before they can do anything else though, THIS happens!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/nV2aKch.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>A giant fucking thing comes and literally eats the Enterprise. La’an explains she thinks it’s the Eater of Worlds. A giant ancient scavenger ship. Ghost story. Interesting. You’d think something like this would be more than just a Legend, but whatever works. Kirk refuses to leave people on the ship, and demands Scotty make miracles. This is actually the first time Kirk and Scotty are even working together. Since Spock is here too, as acting 2nd in command, with Uhura too, it’s practically a TOS reunion party. Just like, a pre-union.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/2J7mGnt.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>The things in charge of this giant Scavenger ship appear to have boarded the Enterprise, and are just fucking Big Daddies.</p>

<p>Kirk is making bad decisions. He ignores all his advisors, and the ship explodes. Not like, fully, it’s just dead in the water. He ignored Scotty, and he’s pushed it too far. He gets angry and refuses to listen to any other advices. He storms off. They decide he needs someone to help him through this, someone with a less emotional style to calm him. Time for the start of Spock x Kirk!!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/FJxOfv8.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>We get to see Pelia’s quarters. It’s absolutely incredible. She digs in a box for some ancient junk. She pulls out a mother fucking Atari. Holy hell. I want to see her video game collection. Communications are being jammed, so her plan? Wire the enterprise with ancient cables and use old-ass phones. That’s honestly fantastic.</p>

<p>We learn what the title of this episode means. The Sehlat that Ate Its Tail is a Vulcan idiom, similar to “the dog that caught the car”. Someone hunting after a thing, then… now what? Kirk, going after leadership, now he’s stuck and frozen. It’s cute. Anyways, Spock and Kirk have a heart to heart, and it helps. He comes back with a new plan. Make their ship look REAL tasty to the scavengers so they’ll come biting, then make them regreat it.</p>

<p>Back on the Enterprise, the Big Daddies refuse to kill Pike after it knocks his helmet off. Weird. Strange.</p>

<p>“I haven’t done this since I was a roadie for the dead!” “…Your species can communicate with dead people?” Holy shit, I LOVE Pelia. When they actually do things with her she’s so funny.</p>

<p>This episode is not doing a LOT with Pike, but it’s doing more than the rest of this season’s done. He’s the CAPTAIN, and he’s barely got any love this season. He’s the best character on this show. Very fun moments with him. “Take a step back, this might blow up.” “Captain, if it does, it’ll blow up the entire engineering section.” “…A very large step back, then?” I love you, Pike.</p>

<p>Spock manages to hit the aliens where they hurt and blow them upm just as the Enterprise escapes.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/lQm5m80.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>We find out the Scavengers were Human. On the side of the ship, they find “XCV-100”, which is a reference to a classic Ship concept. Apparently many years ago, some Humans built a ship to escape an environmental collapse of Earth. But then the ship disappeared, never to be heard from again. But how did they go from THAT, to whatever they became? It’s not explained.</p>

<p>I’m not really sure I like the ending all that much? The big twist? But the lessons Pike imparts to Kirk in the end are good, at least, and the action and jokes are good. It’s like, a solid season 1 or 2 episode.</p>

<p><strong>What is Starfleet</strong> - SNW
2/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/hb6jfUp.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>So for the past season, we’ve seen Beto, Ortegas’ brother, recording a documentary about Starfleet. And now this episode IS that documentary. We get to see this guy’s documentary he made about what Starfleet is. And you know what? It kinda sucks.</p>

<p>We’ll see if, by the end of this, it’s… intentional. But it feels like a first year film student trying to Do Something. To Say Something. But it’s honestly stunning how bad the editing is. That HAS to be the intention, but I don’t care if something is intentionally bad if it’s bad to watch.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ePXmjB1.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>It jumps between scenes with weird camera angles and bad shots. None of the scenes flow together, with the different members of the crew talking about random inane bullshit. Apparently we get a Spock Self Harm backstory. When he was a kid he tried to carve the human half out of him with a knife. Joy. Glad THAT’S canon now.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/J9er1s6.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>Whatever this thing is, it’s pretty.</p>

<p>We see them go do… something in some war. It’s not super well explained. Every character feels weirdly out of character. I THINK that’s the point? They’re being misrepresented for some kid’s school project. Pike is angry and lashing out about the cameras being around. M’Benga is represented as a violent shady war criminal. He tells Uhura her friend is dead, just so he can get her reaction on camera. Oh yeah, just ask your sister on camera, who’s knee deep in PTSD, how her hand is doing after 3/5ths of it was dissolved in Gorn Goo.</p>

<p>Neli, the friend I watch these with, describes it as “them trying to do ‘Faranheit 911’. A kind of shockcumentary that is so up its own ass and full of itself. Yeah.</p>

<p>Also the camera shakes around so much this is so extremely hard to follow and hurts to look at. Beto is… bad at being a documentarian. I’ve said that a lot, but his camera work is ass, as ass as his editing. Why was THIS GUY given full open access to record anything on the flagship of the Federation?? It’d be like giving Uwe Boll unlimited access to do whatever he wants.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/sqdG641.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>Is he RECORDING PEOPLE WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE for this documentary??? I doubt that’s legal in the Federation. At least it seems like everyone on this ship is kind of sick to death of Beto. Uhura tells him to fuck off after he asks her some self pretentious shit about colonizers. At least we know where THAT romance plot is going. I swear, if they STILL try to push a romance with them after this episode, it’ll be even worse than the Worf x Dax bullshit.</p>

<p>So there’s some kinda plot about a society at war with another society, and they’re doing some kind of project to make this giant space amoebas into beasts of war. The neural implant they’re using is torturing it, and it breaks so it can’t be controlled anymore, and it lashes out. They communicate with it telepathically, find out it can’t control itself, and they help it commit suicide. That’s the plot. Honestly, not terrible? I would have liked to watch a normal-ass Trek episode about it. Because the first half is whatever hte fuck was going on there, weird propaganda shit, and this second half is actually Trek-like and kinda okay, but it’s COMPLETELY ruined because I was so extremely checked out. Also the editing and camera work are still fucking ass.</p>

<p>And it just ends. Here’s some comments from a video that put the ending out there clearly:</p>

<p>“The space moth killed itself and that was sad. But is war bad? Well at the end of the day: it is what it is. But most importantly: we are a family. The End” - robstein1313</p>

<p>“Is Star Fleet a military colonizing force? I think the real Star Fleet is the friends we made along the way.” - CouncilofGeeks</p>

<p>All of this was done to give character development to a character that I didn’t really care about and thought was just a little annoying at best, and now I kind of hate him. And this episode.</p>

<p><strong>Four and a Half Vulcans</strong> - SNW
3/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/04GBE4L.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>Something about this title feels insulting</p>

<p>We’ve got more relationship troubles cause that’s all this show does now. La’an is ALREADY making shit awkward with Spock, and Pike’s girlfriend wants to get back to work, and needs Pike’s help making her old boss happy about it. But before we can do ANYTHING like that, we have to do some shenanigans.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/gMfQRpe.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>There’s a very flimsy reason that they need to do this, but they need to all become Vulcans through the reverse of that serum they gave Spock to make him Human for a bit. It doesn’t work on Pelia, who continues to be the best character in this season. The serum makes them all extremely annoying and theyre IMMEDIATELY working overtime to be weirdly racist towards Spock for being a half Vulcan. They go down to do the job they had to do, do it super fast, and then dip back up. But oops, the Vulcan serum doesn’t work and they can’t turn back.</p>

<p>Everyone is handling being a Vulcan Very Poorly. This is just badly written Vulcan things. Yes, logic can be used to justify bad things, like racism, or apparently in La’ans case BECOMING A SPACE CONQUERER? Yeah that’s a thing. Yes, you could justify all that with logic. If you’re a bad person who wants to come up with any reason to be bad you can do that. It’s very easy! But these are not bad people. These are good people who want to do good things. But they are not now, because of bad writing.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/SPXpIT9.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>They decide to stay as Vulcans (though La’an is clearly actually a Romulan, which could be VERY bad), because it’s so much better for everyone. Obviously. I say this is grounds for IMMEDIATELY locking them up and mutinying, but even Spock is like “maybe we should not do that”, and he’s being shafted so hard. All the Vulcans do horrible things, like Uhura LTERALLY brainwashes Beto. Hmm. They need help, so Una seeks help from her ex, Doug.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/CZKI7VS.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>This is Doug. He’s a Vulcan who is fond of Human cultures and when he and Una are nearby each other they want to make out with each other violently. It’s comedic in a way that does NOT fit. Doug agrees to help them connect with the Vulcan’s katras, which they, no joke, do off screen. Just, cut to black, come back in, “Anyways we solved it”. Are you shitting my dick????</p>

<p>Only one person is resisting being brought back, and that’s La’an. Spock talks to her inside her mind, and he straight up says “Your sadistic and untrusting and violent, that’s because you are related to Khan”. WE LITERALLY HAD AN EPISODE ABOUT THIS, ABOUT HOW BIO-ESSENTIALISM ISN’T REAL AND SHE CAME TO ACCEPT THAT PART OF HERSELF. BUT NOW NO, BIO ESSENTIALISM IS REAL. YOU’RE EVIL, LIKE ALL IN YOUR LINE.</p>

<p>They fight, then dance, and then she goes “okay yes change me back”. The rest of the episode is like 10 more minutes of everyone going “holy shit I’m so sorry for being awful” and then it ends. This episode kinda sucked. The writing was DRASTICALLY uneven. There were some fun moments and a lot of really bad ones.</p>

<p>At the end though you have Spock giving Doug a How To Be A Human lesson and I kinda like that.</p>

<p><strong>Terrarium</strong> - SNW
7/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/btQTDWc.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>This is something I’ve wanted since Strange New Worlds first came out. We’re FINALLY getting it. An Ortegas central episode. Ortegas has always been around and good with snarking in the sidelines, but she’s never gotten her own centric episode. Everyone else has gotten like, 3 each. So why am I worried?</p>

<p>Because the writing has been pretty bad this season, AND they have this “Ortegas has PTSD” side plot. I can think of a MILLION ways they could fuck this up.</p>

<p>Ortegas is sent out in a shuttle to do a simple solo mission to release a subspace relay, when suddenly a wormhole pops up RIGHT on top of her and she’s sucked into it. Enterprise sees her disappear, with her last line being “I’VE GOT IT! I’VE GOT-“. And then boom, she’s gone. Damn, rest in peace, Ortegas.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/zFOXC4C.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>No, obviously not. She manages to release the buoy before crash landing. Her rations get burned up in the crash, I dunno why you’d put the rations next to the explodium. So she goes about preparing to survive on a hostile alien world.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/LoVVWiI.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>Okay, props to the writers of this so far. If you asked me how Ortegas would handle being stranded on an alien planet, it’s EXACTLY this. She’d talk to herself a lot and be sassy. Honestly, they don’t even need writers. Point a camera at a good actor and let her adlib for 45 minutes, and you’ve got an Ortegas episode. Fantastic. She’s doin’ shit like building a condensor and going “Hello Mr. Condensor, please Condense” like, I love it?</p>

<p>Back on Enterprise, they gotta go meet Captain Decker of the Constellation soon so they don’t have time to stick around for a rescue. If you don’t remember, Decker is from the episode of TOS where they fight the Planet Eater. Or as I call it, The Windsock, and as I call him, The Windsock Guy. Uhura is DETERMINED to get Ortegas back, and fights for them to stay.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/dpfOrtm.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>Ortegas finds a Gorn living on the moon she’s stranded on. At first it seems like they’re gonna fight, but the Gorn is actually… not very aggressive? It kills something and gives Ortegas some of it. It’s a disgusting bug, but hey, shockingly friendly Gorn. The Gorn is injured, though, and Ortegas obviously doesn’t trust it, so she basically robs the Gorn and tries to run away back to her shelter. She sees a light in the sky, aaaand the shuttle falls into a sinkhole. Whoops. Ortegas is then attacked by more bugs, but is SAVED by the Gorn! New Gorn Best Friend :o</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/QHOWVNj.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>Ortegas can’t really communicate with the Gorn easily, but fashions a communicator that can give yes or nos, basically. The Gorn can actually understand her, because “you want to understand your enemy?” “Agree”. The Gorn and Ortegas spend time getting to know one another. It’s a girl Gorn, so it’s “a couple of girls having a slumber party”. Ortegas teaches her Chess, she teaches her some kind of game. They actually get along rather well. New Gorn GIRLFRIEND?!</p>

<p>The Gorn is too injured, and if it’s rescued, that’s a death sentence. The Gorn blow up their own ships if they’re too weak. Ortegas is like “Well, then come with us, and show my people that you’re as wonderful as you showed me!” The Gorn doesn’t seem very happy about that. All the while, Ortegas feels like she’s being watched, and there’s these weird lights in the sky. I think I know what’s going on.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/qaesgzY.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>Ortegas and the Gorn work together, Ortegas convincing her to TRY and stay alive, and they have one wild plan. Light a GIANT explosion that’ll hopefully alert Enterprise they’re there and get them teleported out. Ortegas risks her life to light the flare, getting the attention of Enterprise… but also something else. And when Enterprise comes and immediately blasts the Gorn, killing it, Ortegas goes NUTS. Screaming out at whatever’s watching her. And it’s…</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/rdScTg6.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>I FUCKING CALLED IT. The Metron is like “We need more data to determine if the Gorn and the Humans can ever find peace.” AKA, Arena. The Metron says Ortegas isn’t ready to meet them, erases her memories, and then they’re sent back. And the Gorn? Still dead. Still very, very dead. Fucking god dammit. My Gorlnfriend &gt;:(</p>

<p>This was FANTASTIC until the bad feeling at the end. It’s just a shaggy dog story. And the Metron being there actually doesn’t add much, it prolly would have been better without it. Weirdly nostalgia bating for nothing to add to it. This WOULD have been a 9/10, maybe even higher, if they had stuck that landing. But right now it’s just…. kinda anger enducing.</p>

<p><strong>New Life and New Civilizations</strong> - SNW
3/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/4cgRq8Z.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>We start with a party in Pike’s quarters to celebrate Patel leaving the Enterprise. Everyone looks fantastic. Spock is just wearing his normal outfit though, and he’s also hushing the buzz by talking about evil lizard bullshit at the party. Read the room, Spock.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/jwOVlP4.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>WHY IS ROGER KORBY ON FUCKING ZENDIKAR</p>

<p>WHY IS ZENDIKAR CANON TO THE STAR TREK UNIVERSE</p>

<p>Anyways Korby doing some kinda science thing on a place and it’s interrupted by… GAMBLE! Dun dun dun! His pattern is taken out of the buffer which is a bit weird, considering his pattern wasn’t put INTO it really, the pokeball was instead, but whatever. If you don’t remember, Gamble was possessed by a Vezda, some ancient energy being. They all plan to go rescue Korby and figure out wtf is going on and stop the Vezda. Patel is going too, cause her Gorn DNA is making her go. As if the death flags weren’t already raised. Everyone is getting in on this. Even <strong>J Kirk</strong>. Why? Because it’s the finale, we need all the characters here, and we have SO many of them. This is really where only 10 episodes per season is stretching this.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/NkSOsVC.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>Anyways some of the people here worship the Vezda. There’s also something about destiny and M’Benga? It’s weird, it makes no sense. But the Vezda basically kidnaps M’Benga and uses him to transport to the prison where all the Vezda are, and then releases the other Vezda.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/8KnzsM8.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>Patel now has Star Child eyes. Chapel finds out that her life signs are the same as the Beholder Statue that was locking the Vezda in. What the fuck is going on? This is nonsense. The pacing is off. There’s some shit about how the Vezda are inherent primal evil, which is stupid nonsense I won’t even dignify that with a response, but also becoming hybridized for some reason wakes up genetic memory where she’s now built to Fight Evil. THE GORN SAVED THE GALAXY AGAINST AN ANCIENT EVIL? Whatever. She’s becoming Captain Marvel.</p>

<p>This is dumb beyond words.</p>

<p>“We have to get power to Patel and Pike” oh you know, Power. Just gotta Beam Them Power. And a ship can generate exactly half of that and shoot it in a phaser blast. Luckily Kirk is here. Remember btw Kirk is NOT the Captain of the Farragut. Why is he their contact on the Farragut? Talk to the fucking captain about this. Anyways they’ll both have to shoot a laser at the ship perfectly connected. And they do this via a mind link.</p>

<p>Spirk hinting is going to be the best thing about this episode.</p>

<p>Anyways they mind meld and now are mind connected and talking, away from each other, in two seperate ships. This is not how this works. This is not, and has never been, how mind melds work. We are knee deep in the writers strike right now fellas. Anyways Pike and Patel make their way in to Vezda Jail, and she’s about to have a fucking wizard duel when suddenly it’s interrupted by what seems to be a jump cut where she and Pike are happily married.</p>

<p>It’s obviously some kind of lotus eater machine.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/jj7hjSS.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>It’s nice to see them age gracefully and live a nice happy comfy life at least. Pike doesn’t get mutilated, life goes on. He’s very confused but they don’t go “oh we’re in a lotus eater machine”, it takes a long time for them to figure anything out. There’s also a lot of stuff about knocking at the door, I dunno. It’s not quite Inner Light, I’ll say that. She says some shit about how she needed this so that she could remember him, and then</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/4w7XX72.png" alt="trek"></p>

<p>We’re back to your previously scheduled Wizard Duel. Patel uses Magic to become a new statue, and that’s it.</p>

<p>We get some attempts at closure. Kirk and Spock literally go “We will always be friends”. Also remember the hot three armed bartender from episode 2 of this season? Not there. WTF. Why even have the promise of her??</p>

<p>We get a voice over by Pike about “No one we’ve truly loved is ever gone” and it’s… okay I guess. He’s a bit depressed but he’s doing his best.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>This season was bad!!</p>

<p>Almost the entirety of it was not good to bad! Like, wow! I’m astounded!!! Considering the high highs of season 1 and 2, it’s wiiiild. It’d be like going from TNG season 5 to TNG Season 1. Like, it’s not the worst, and there are highlights, but bluh.</p>

<p>One of my biggest problems is that Pike was kinda pushed into the background for a lot of it. But that’s not even close to the biggest issue. I dunno. Let’s hope for better???</p>
