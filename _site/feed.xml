<p>Yes, this IS a game. Kind of. So the 32X bombed like, real hard. Like a lot of bombed consoles, this resulted in a lot of games being cancelled. Most of the time we just get little hints at what could have been, screen shots in magazines, some developer explanations. But here, we get the full on prototype of a cancelled 32X game, Virtual Hamster! Its weird.</p>

<p>The only way to describe this, is you are a hamster on a hoverboard going through cyber tubes. Imagine the Sonic 2 halfpipe stages, it’s BASICALLY that. You slide down along the sides cause of gravity, but can move all around if you get good momentum. There are enemies, though they don’t seem to do anything, and there are powerups, they don’t do anything either.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Snktm9F.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>There’s a big full map, which is just a tied up knot of tunnels. Sometimes a turn comes in the pipeway, and you’ll go in the direction you’re tilted, left or right. This makes it VERY confusing to know where the fuck you’re going, but there IS a map, which helps. Though uh, helps for what? That’s it. There’s nothing else here.</p>

<p>Virtual Hamster is a weird game, a look into the hints of what game dev was like at the time, but even with that, I have no idea what this would be. Probably not super fun lol</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="32X" /><category term="prototype" /><category term="Virtual Hamster" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">LizstarTrek - Voyager Season 5 episodes 11-15</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/lizstartrek/2025/06/01/LizstartrekVOY6-3.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="LizstarTrek - Voyager Season 5 episodes 11-15" /><published>2025-06-01T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-06-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/lizstartrek/2025/06/01/LizstartrekVOY6-3</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/lizstartrek/2025/06/01/LizstartrekVOY6-3.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Qh1U7nT.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p><strong>Fair Haven</strong> - VOY
6/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/MWNHUpY.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This episode is totally a “We had this set on lot” episode, and they just ran with it.</p>

<p>In this episode, Paris has invented a new holoprogram called Fair Haven, which is an idealized version of a 19th century Irish village. Paris makes it clear, he wants this to be just what it is. No aliens, no leprachauns, no magic. Just… a place to escape and relax. A lot of people get into it. The Doctor sets himself as a priest, for example. And according to him, Janeway is very into Irish history. Oh… she is? I mean, yeah, of course! We all remember…. that aspect about her! She also gives eyes at a bartender, which Worries me because Star Trek NEVER does one episode romance well.</p>

<p>Suddenly the episode becomes a completely different episode as they’re all studying an anomaly. It’s gonna make them sit there for a few days. To keep spirits up, they have the holodecks running at all times.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/expjNUT.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>At the very least, this episode isn’t like…. okay, do you remember that episode of TNG where they’re evacuating a colony that’s literally just Ireland? This is better than that, but I’m always worried when an episode is like the “THIS CULTURE” episode. Like, even if it’s something where I’m like “you can’t be racist to it, they’re white people” if this was a French episode and everyone was holding baguettes and goin’ HON HON HON you’d be like “okay I dunno about this”. This is treading very, very carefully on that. And when I say it’s the Irish episode, like, it’s VERY Irish. It’s all anyone is talking about, basically.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/JIqc8aw.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Janeway goes into the program’s data and makes some edits (probably without Paris’ knowledge of wanting of her doing that) to the bartender. I have never seen a woman more downbad than this one image. Look at her fuckin’ DRAPED. She makes some edits to his background, makes him more into arts and literature. Makes him more “complicated”, more confrontational (Janeway is a bottom, okay, that’s not what I expected). And then…. one of the best lines I’ve ever seen in a Star Trek episode.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/7GBqO96.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>DELETE. THE. WIFE.</p>

<p>Okay so Kate Mulgrew is very hot and if she was being horny at me, I’d become a puddle on the floor, but there’s something massively uncomfortable about watching Star Trek characters be horny, in that same way I don’t like romance plots in these episodes. I mean, thinking about it in the most abject way, bringing it down to its most base concepts, Captain Janeway is currently making a holofuck doll. To her EXACT specifications. It’s weird now when horny 28 year olds who never aged past 14 do it, and it’s weird when she does it. It’s just weird, and uncomfortable. At the very least, AT THE VERY LEAST, this time it’s not a fucking nazi.</p>

<p>Good scene with Seven and some random guy in the bartender</p>

<p>“I possess superior hand-eye coordination.”
“That’s not all that’s superior. The lily and the rose are staging a competition on your face.”
“Clarify.”
“The fullness of your lips and the paleness of your cheeks – it’s enough to make a man faint.”
“Then, in that case, perhaps we should sit down.”</p>

<p>Dude’s got game. That’d work on me.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/2peVRo8.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Things go further with the bartender, Michael Sullivan, and he and Janeway kiss. She then ghosts him when she kinda freaks out about it. He then starts a fucking bar fight with Paris over “WHERE IS SHE”. When Janeway finds out, the Doctor takes her on a walk around the deck. Like, literally, they circle the set like 2 times. She admits to him what made her freak out. It wasn’t a “oh no I’m falling for him, a hologram” thing like I thought it might be. Cause like, she had a LONG time to stop that. No, she was there, cuddling with him… and then he began to snore. She was like “Oh, don’t like that. Oh well, I can just change it” and then realized that’s <em>kinda fucked up</em>, and it made her freak out.</p>

<p>The idea of falling in love with someone who you can meld and control all of their feelings and thoughts and very being, that IS uncomfortable, and is it really love? The Doctor makes the argument that it doesn’t matter what he is or how his molecules are aligned, what matters is the kind of person he and she are. Though maybe don’t edit his program in the future.</p>

<p>They make it clear of the anomaly, though it destabalizes the program that’s currently running, Fair Haven. They can maybe save like, 10% of it. Paris asks Janeway if there’s anything she wants him to try and save specifically.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/dTDSSDk.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>She brings him up and lets him know she’s not gonna be around as much. But she might be around in the future, cause she can’t quit him. And then she makes one last change to his behavioral subroutines. “Deny Janeway any future access to editing his behavioral subroutines”. That’s nice. Though I notice she DIDN’T deny access to physical subroutines.</p>

<p>“Computer. 12 inches.” And then he becomes 12 inches and she’s like “wait wait wait”</p>

<p>It’s fine. I kinda like where it took things by the end but it was a bit wishy washy about that, too.</p>

<p><strong>Blink of an Eye</strong> - VOY
10/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Ez2CTgd.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Voyager finds a torus planet in space. Oh shit, it’s a Final Fantasy world. They go to look at it but get dragged into orbit.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on the planet, a new light appears in the sky as the planet starts shaking. The inhabitants of the planet begin to worship the new star, calling it “Earthshaker”, the new greatest god in the sky.</p>

<p>Back on Voyager, we find ourselves stuck in orbit, unable to escape due to engineering problems. They’re working on that. They also register that due to some Plotium core in the planet, the planet is in a different timeline than us, basically. For every second above, a full year happens down there.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ZJSGmf3.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We then jump ahead, a few minutes for them, centuries for the people on the surface. It’s like an early medieval age now. We’ve got a “Protector” and his sage advisor. He sends a message up to the Earthshaker asking it to stop shaking their planet, as it keeps knocking down their walls and, worst of all, made him trip during an important meeting.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ru74JdI.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Jump ahead even further, to a like…. early 1900s almost. They’re studying Voyager now through telescopes, and know it’s a ship. They call it the Sky Ship. They have comics and stories about it. THey send radio waves up with prime numbers, and a message like “Hey, please stop shaking our planet. I hope you’re a friend.”</p>

<p>This is VERY interesting. Prime Directive is kind of out the window considering what’s been going on, but they DO want to try and minimize damage as much as they can. They decide to send down a spy, but any person they send down there would prolly die from the temporal shock, at least. So they send down the Doctor. They try to bring him back quickly but lose him due to problems, and then finally manage to bring him back… three years later, for him. He explains that they people on the surface are perfectly pleasant and technologically advancing, in part due to Voyager. But there’s also a space race. Who can get to the spaceship first. And for some, it’s for science and exploration. For others…. it’s for war and power. As with any multi cultural planet, right?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/w2nvPbw.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Some astronauts blast up. Luckily, they’re an exploration type. They go up, and then all their messages suddenly get weird and garbled. Huh, that’s strange. Well, their job is to try and learn all they can from the Sky Ship. They dock, go in, and everyone is frozen. And then the time collapses on them VERY suddenly, killing one, but the other can be saved. He’s an anxious guy, but very smart. He’s excited to be here. Scared. Everyone he knew is now dead down there. But he wants to help them, and this was always his dream. He’s also worried because knowing how life is in the rest of the universe, he’s afraid his people may not be able to explore space, which was always his dream.</p>

<p>While he’s up there, technology keeps growing. Aaaand they developed warp technology. And then they send fucking torpedos up. While I’m like “what the fuck” I DO kinda get it. The astronaut goes back down to try and tell them to stop. His people have become a bit more militaristic, and when he tries to communicate, they’re like “Who the hell are you? You’re dead. Good thing you left, we’re about to blow it out of the sky.”</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/fnq6wGc.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Voyager’s shields go down to zero JUST as something else comes up… it’s the astronaut! He beams on with a temporal compensator, and explains he can’t stay for long, the technology isn’t QUITE there yet. But he wishes them luck, helps them escape, and then we end with him, old now, watching the light fade out in the sky.</p>

<p>This is peak Star Trek. In the following episodes,</p>

<p><strong>Virtuoso</strong> - VOY
7.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/OjAlB0J.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Voyager has run into some aliens who are like, the fucking worst. The Qomar, they are rude, egotistical, and awful all around. They treat the Doctor like he’s nothing (one of them over ennunciates as if he can’t understand her, so I guess they’re from the American Planet), call them all inferior, and complain that their inferior technology damaged their systems. Voyager is trying to help them repair it, and while the doctor prepares their medicine, he absently hums. Well at least this time they didn’t just invent a hobby for him. Last episode Chakotay was like “You know I love anthropology”, and the one before that “Janeway has ALWAYS been into the Irish”. This time he at least has an established enjoyment of singing.</p>

<p>Anyways, these aliens never actually invented music, so they are STUNNED. “It’s a unique mathematical variation, how did they invent it???” And he’s like “what”.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/zmuC67G.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Did you ever want an episode that was just Robert Picardo singing? I didn’t know I wanted that, but that’s what this is! The Qomar ask to get a concert (well, they want full access to the doctor), and Janeway suggests a concert. They put on a concert, with the Doctor as a star attraction. They’re REALLY into it, but when they try and get anyone else on like Kim playing clarinet, they ONLY want the Doctor. Poor Kim. It DOES stroke the Doctor’s ego, though.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/5mPw7Ov.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Doctor gets more and more popular among the Qomar. THey’re very, VERY excited and interested in learning more. He puts on some concerts on the planet, and they LOVE it. Seven then calls Janeway over and suggests the Qomar are trying to sabatoge Voyager by sending so much useless data to their comms systems by literally DDOSing Voyager. And with what? Fan mail. So much fan mail asking stupid irrelevent questions like, how much can he calculate pi?</p>

<p>Is this episode a commentary on how people who watched Voyager only cared about the Doctor? Is this episode a commentary on <em>me</em>? Prolly more just fandom in general, which is a little much. The Doctor lets more and more things get to his head. Some Qomar try to seduce the Doctor, which makes him so uncomfortable he turns himself off. One of them, Tincoo, seems to be falling fo him. And then of course, there’s THIS.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ZHIVZ59.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This is the funniest shit I’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>The Doctor gets SO into this that he requests to leave Voyager and stay with the Qomar. Again, a lot of this is because of ego, and because he thinks one of the Qomar is falling for him (they’re obviously not). This is OBVIOUSLY a very bad idea, and is not how this is going to actually go. And most people are not taking it well. His closest friends are kind of offended he’s leaving just for his ego, like Seven. It’s nice that she’s like, very VERY hurt about all this.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/6Ac7PZF.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>So, this is a program the girl he THOUGHT was into him made to replace him. He can sing in ways the Doctor can’t, superior in every way. They’re making a Hatsune Miku. The Doctor almost realizes how fucking stupid he’s being about all of this. Almost. He has a bit of a breakdown, like, “BELANNA, I NEED YOU TO ERASE MY MEDICAL SUBROUTINES AND MAKE ME BETTER AT MUSIC”. He’s ALMOST burned too many bridges to do this, but she eventually hits him with a “You know, I CAN do this and turn you into just a music bot, but you won’t be you anymore”. He’d sacrifice everything he is, and has, to keep famous. And is that really worth it?</p>

<p>He gives one last Opera performance, this being the only one NOT performed by Robert Picardo, as Tincoo watches. Tincoo then introduces her new Doctor Clone. The Qomar are super, SUPER into it, and immediately forget that stinky old Doctor they used to have singing for him. How fickle is fame? There’s a hard fucking cut with him singing a weird song that’s like, just noise. Which IS a valid kind of music, but you know. Not when it’s made by kind of a dickhead.</p>

<p>The Doctor had ended up offending a lot of the crew, but he’s reinstated. He’s willing to erase his singing subroutines, but is told “nah you don’t need to go that far”. He’s kind of disgusted by the whole thing, and when Seven delivers more fanmail, he’s like “fuck that shit”, but she reads it anyway. It’s fanmail from her, to him, about how much she respects him.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/4x3P9cB.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>It’s genuinely a really heartwarming ending. Not a bad episode over all.</p>

<p><strong>Memorial</strong> - VOY
10/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/oKhC472.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Paris, Neelix, Chakotay, and Harry return home to Voyager after a two week away mission. Harry is just glad to be back home with working sonic showers and not near three other smelly men. Paris returns to Torres, who built him an authentic 50s TV, which is VERY cute and adorable. He stays up late watching old cartoons, and then the TV swaps to a war movie, which bothers him for some reason, but he can’t change the channel. And then he sees himself in the TV. Huh! Interesting setup.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/GRQEeg2.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>It’s not just him. Kim hallucinates in the Jeffries Tubes. Neelix freaks out at a kettle whistle and people sneaking up on him. He becomes VERY protective of Naomi, telling her to “Get down” behind the counter as people come in. Chakotay is having nightmares of a battle, but is woken up by Tuvok telling him that Neelix has barricaded himself in the messhall and is basically holding Naomi hostage (he thinks he’s protecting her).</p>

<p>Obviously something is wrong. They appear to have been in a war, and they don’t even remember it. And it doesn’t help that everyone appears to be suffering from terrible PTSD. Well, everyone except Chakotay, who still cannot act. THey remember volunteering, though the fact that they can’t even remember what happened implies they were kind of coerced.</p>

<p>Their memories slowly come back. They were working to try and evacuate some aliens, the Nakan. Something happened, no one knows what, no one saw. Either their people fired first, or some colonists. Some of the soldiers tried to protect the colonists. Some didn’t, just shooting them out of fear.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/YVQoEQL.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>How each of them handles this is different. Harry is scared, and shoots some of the colonists. Neelix tries to protect them, and thinks they shouldn’t have even been there in the first place. Either way, 82 civilians were killed in a massacre. All of them. No survivors.</p>

<p>Neelix and Harry have nervous breakdowns over what they did. Paris is next, screaming at Belanna to leave him alone so he can just stare at a wall. I mean I do get that, tbh. Chakotay is there.</p>

<p>They go over the logs, go to the system where it happened, and then JANEWAY remembers being there, killing civilians. But she was very, VERY clearly on Voyager for two weeks. The scene we get with her is GRAPHIC. Her commander shoots the corpses, and is like “we will cover up the evidence”, and she’s DISGUSTED, demanding that they need to band together and make sure no one forgets. But most of the rest of them refuse, getting belligerent. Whatever IS happening here is also starting to spread. The entire ship is being pulled into this alien conflict, in their memories.</p>

<p>Janeway NEEDS to know that it wasn’t ACTUALLY athing they did that just became erased somehow. They set a course.</p>

<p>Neelix asks Seven how she handles the memories of what she did was a Borg. Is it because guilt is irrelevant? No, of course not. It is VERY important. She remembers what she did frequently, and moves on, lets it guide her, so she never hurts anyone ever again. It’s a VERY good scene.</p>

<p>They land on the planet, and go hunting. Harry find the victims he personally killed, and finds… corpses, yes. But they died 300 years ago. More exploration, and they find a giant memorial that occasionally pulses. The soldiers here (or SOMEONE) built this memorial, sending out a memory pulse to anyone passing by, so that it wouldn’t be forgotten. No one will forget. Most of Voyager is like “okay good, let’s turn it off now”. But Neelix is like “we can’t turn this off and destroy the evidence”. I think this an interesting moral dilemma, and for the record, some of my chat disagree on this a lot. Janeway eventually decides not to turn it off, and instead puts a warning bouy near the system. Prolly the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>They leave, but they will NEVER forget.</p>

<p>Very interesting episode.</p>

<p><strong>Tsunkatse</strong> - VOY
9/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/QKIvIp6.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This episode is very interesting for one reason, and it’s this:</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/0C6S71X.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>SPECIAL GUEST: THE ROCK. YEP. This was The Rock’s first acting gig that wasn’t wrestling.</p>

<p>We start with a blood match, some kind of fighting MMA match. Something called “Tsunkatse”. Chakotay and Torres are REAL into it, which… I dunno if Federation officers SHOULD be, but okay. While here on shore leave, they’re excited to catch more Tsunkatse matches. Most of the crew is into shore leave either for that, or for other things. Neelix gets sunburnt. But Seven and Tuvok go to study a micronebula instead. We’ve always had “logic” characters in this series, but we’ve never had two at once. It’s really fun, they bounce off each other well.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/mOsaqxe.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>While studying the micronebula, a ship comes, disables their shuttle, and plants a bomb on it, blowing it the fuck up. Seven then wakes up right in front of fucking Weyoun. No, it’s some other alien, but it’s played by Jeffrey Combs, who is using the EXACT same voice he uses for Weyoun. One of the other aliens with him is also Martok. Damn, all star cast. This new guy, this ringleader of the blood fights, is like “I will treat Tuvok, who’s injuries are severe, if you fight for us”. So Seven complies, unhappily.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/pTGMzIa.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The rest of the crew goes to see the combat. Exciting, I wonder who’s gonna fight! :D Aaaaand there he is. Of course he can’t act, all he can do is that fuckin’ eyebrow thing he does.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/U4aqXIT.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Oh they’re so excited to see this guy throw people into the stands, ha ha, what a fun blood sport! Oh no, now that someone you KNOW is being forced to fight in the bloodsport now it’s not so enjoyable.</p>

<p>She and The Rock fight, and it’s pretty hot to see Seven kick ass. She keeps hesitating, because y’know, she doesn’t want to be there and doesn’t wanna hurt anyone. The Rock doesn’t feel the same way, and beats the hell of her after her hesitation. She loses, though this makes Not-Weyoun very happy, because so many people were REALLY excited to see a Borg get injured. Imagine how many would tune in to see a Borg die! Ooohoo, how exciting. There’s a Hirojan, the one played by Martok, who basically adopts her and tries to help her survive.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Xq55J6s.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>He has a tragic past, being captured with his son, who he never saw again. He might be imprinting him on her, though that doesn’t mean he goes easy on her.</p>

<p>The crew is now all “I can’t BELIEVE that this society is so into this gross bloodsport” which is very funny considering how into it they all were. Which y’know, is the point.</p>

<p>It’s time for the fight. The “Red Match”. Seven is NOT happy about having to kill someone to survive, but whatever it takes to survive. But who is her opponent? I think we know.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/4Wf460g.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>He wants a death his son would be proud of. If she won’t fight, then he’ll be forced to kill her.</p>

<p>What proceeds is a fight. The Hirojen ends up basically coercing her to fight by calling her imperfect. Meanwhile, Voyager comes and fires on the fighter ship, and beam over Tuvok. Buuut it looks like they might not be enough, until the Delta Flyer comes over to Big Damn Heroes the day. And just as Seven is going to kill the Hirojen (he begs for it, saying to not let her prey suffer), they’re teleported over. Both of them, safe and sound. The Hirogen goes to hunt for his son, but not before sharing one more moment with Seven. They’re lucky there was a way out. This time. And then she has one with Tuvok. They both like silence, but here they have a reason to speak.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/OW3kxyt.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>She spent the past three years trying to regain her humanity, and almost killed someone. Tuvok explains that that feeling she feels, shame, remorse? That shows she has not lost it, and never will. It’s good.</p>

<p>Really good episode. It’s stupid that this is “THE ROCK EPISODE” when he was in two and a half minutes, said three lines, and could not act.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="Voyager" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 148</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/05/31/OOCY148.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 148" /><published>2025-05-31T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-05-31T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/05/31/OOCY148</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/05/31/OOCY148.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/IxW0F06.png" alt="'Um, Rika-sensei, there's something I wanna know... how do you hit on another girl?!'" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>vvvvvv is a game that I utterly adore, and have for years. I replay it all the time. This is not a port of vvvvvv, though. This is a port of one specific part of it, and one that kind of took the internet by storm. There’s a level in vvvvvv called the Gravitron, and when it got its big full release, there was the Super Gravitron, or whatever it was called. This is a port of that.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/12RoN8W.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>You bounce along the floor and ceiling, ping-ponging back and forth, as obstacles fly in from the side. Dodging them is pretty damn hard, I’m not gonna lie. For this set, the goal is to survive for only 20 seconds, and that was genuinely quite difficult. I remember the Ultra Gravitron being a bit easier than this. Maybe the patterns are different or faster? Either way, it’s still a fun little time. Port vvvvvv next pls, I love that game.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="NES" /><category term="homebrew" /><category term="vvvvvv" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 147</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/05/28/OOCY147.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 147" /><published>2025-05-28T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-05-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/05/28/OOCY147</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/05/28/OOCY147.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/VfRfTJE.png" alt="A hamster is crawling around on a girl.

<p>Hi there! I’m Jack Rabbit! I love carrots, and I’m very hungry! Wuh.</p>

<p>These are the words said by Jack Rabbit, the titual character of 1984 arcade game Jack Rabbit, by Zaccaria. Zaccaria was an Italian pinball and arcade company, and they invented a voice synthesis technique, which they used in two arcade games. This one, and Money Money. Basically, Jack Rabbit talks between levels.</p>

<p>This game is kind of a meme in some circles, because he’s SUPPOSED to say “Will you help me?” after his “I’m very hungry” line. However, the speed of the synthesis was off in MAME when it was first put in mame, so he talked a bit slower and was cut off, so he just went “wuh”. Wuh.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/7DlHEOy.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Jack Rabbit is kind of like a maze game mixed with some Qbert? You hop in an isometric space, with three different maps. Once you collect all of the carrots, you move to the next stage. You can hop one square, OR hold the button to do a twice as large hop so you can hop over pits and stuff. The first stage is a farm, the second is an auto scrolling desert that gets VERY fast in later loops, and the third is an island chain you have to jump between.</p>

<p>Jack Rabbit isn’t a complex game, but it’s just the right level of simple to fun. In my opinion, this is a fantastic little game that’s great to try and grind out high score to for 30 minutes every now and then. Plus it’s got a fun little story! Wuh.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Arcade" /><category term="Obscure Games" /><category term="Jack Rabbit" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 146</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/05/22/OOCY146.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 146" /><published>2025-05-22T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-05-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/05/22/OOCY146</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/05/22/OOCY146.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/sOWAx2D.png" alt="'I want to kiss her, that's for sure.

<p>This is gonna be a different kind of review.</p>

<p>Allow me to tell you a story. It’s 1998, probably October or November, and I’m 5 years old. My parents have taken me to the local skating rink to ride around in circles, or more accurately for me, fall on my ass a bunch. After falling on my ass a bunch, I went to the break area and saw my neighbor playing on his Gameboy. I asked him what he was playing, and he showed me this new game he had recently rented called Pokemon. He described it as, and I’m not making this up, a game where you rent monsters to battle other monsters. Anyways I thought it looked like the sickest shit, so that night I went home and went to my brother and said “Jeff, I saw a new game we have to get! Pokemans!”</p>

<p>He will never let me live that down. Anyways, the rest, as they say, is history.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/xTKA5pU.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Trying to review Pokemon Red/Blue is a fascinating task. This game is so etched into history at this point, but in a completely different way than other games. Let me peel back the veil for a bit. When I’m writing these, I usually grab an image or two from Google so it’s not just a wall of text. As an example, I’ll use a game I just beat, Dragon Quest 4. I go on Google, search “Dragon Quest 4 NES” and I get two box art images, and the rest are in game pictures. That’s cool. But if I search “Pokemon Red Gameboy” or anything like that, I do not get in game images. I get box art and cartridges. I have to scroll a LOT to get any in game pictures at all.</p>

<p>I think Pokemon has outgrown its video games. Pokemon isn’t really a game series anymore, it’s the largest multimedia franchise of all fucking time. To Google, the idea of Pokemon, and specifically owning one of the millions of shitty overpriced repro carts that are on marketplaces that everyone is still buying for some reason, is far more important than the actual game itself. Now, I don’t respect Google or its algorithms, at all, so I’m not about to say that’s reflective of all of culture. But it’s at least a small window into the realities of it.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/0noXNoi.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>The Pokemon story has evolved into a kind of mythos. You can find videos online talking about everything about the series, and I watch them all, because I’m a fan. Though I hate calling myself that, because in my personal opinion, there are NO fans worse than Pokemon fans. People will shit talk every Nintendo series fandon, but let me tell you, I didn’t get THREE SEPERATE EMAILS from those fan groups because I dared to showcase a woman runner on a speedrunning marathon.</p>

<p>The mythos of Pokemon Red/Blue also has a lot of discourse around it, too. Some will tell you this game is actually dogshit garbage, and has no business being played today. Just play FireRed/LeafGreen. I mean sure, those are good games too, but bugs and questional design decisions don’t ruin the enjoyment of a game. This game is pure nostalgia bait, and it makes me happy to play it, and really that’s what matters. I don’t care that you literally cannot play the game without running into some kind of bug, or that the balance is so fucked. Those poor, poor Bug/Dragon/Ghost types, jesus. And that’s not even getting started on the Fighting type. Yes, that’s all bad, but this game has grown so far beyond it and its own personal flaws that I really don’t care that much.</p>

<p>I go back every few years to play this one. This is actually my second time recently, I did a Prof Oak challenge last year. And I’ll probably play it again sometime soon in the future. It just makes me feel good.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Gameboy" /><category term="Retro Games" /><category term="Pokemon" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">LizstarTrek - Voyager Season 5 episodes 6-10</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/lizstartrek/2025/05/18/LizstartrekVOY6-2.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="LizstarTrek - Voyager Season 5 episodes 6-10" /><published>2025-05-18T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-05-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/lizstartrek/2025/05/18/LizstartrekVOY6-2</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/lizstartrek/2025/05/18/LizstartrekVOY6-2.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Qh1U7nT.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p><strong>Riddles</strong> - VOY
8/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/L12TVW2.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Neelix and Tuvok are on the Delta Flyer, which is WAY fucking larger than I thought it was. Neelix is annoying Tuvok, who as usual, seems to detest everyone he’s ever met, but ESPECIALLY Neelix. Maybe it’s espcially weird between them considering The Episode That Must Not Be Mentioned. Anyways Tuvok gets grumpy after Neelix gives him a bad riddle, he goes back to the back to find that an alien is downloading some files from the computer. It attacks Neelix and he has a seizure.</p>

<p>They get some information from a nearby alien species. The ambasaddor to them believes it’s a species called The Ba’Neth, which his government claims does not actually exist. He’s basically a conspiracy theorist about these guys, adamant they DO exist, even though no one’s ever seen them, and there have only been 13 known attacks. Tuvok was the first attacked who survived! Lucky Tuvok.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/wQljDTM.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Neelix feels guilty for what happened to Tuvok, so he does his best to make Tuvok comfy. The Doctor suggests that sometimes people wake from comas if they’re talked to or have smells, so Neelix goes ALL OUT. It works, and Tuvok wakes up, though his brain has been damaged, so he’s kind of running on instinct. He’s scared of the tricorder, for example. Neelix takes him on tours to try and jog his memory, and everyone is kind of worried and disturbed. They don’t know if he’ll ever recover.</p>

<p>They study the Ba’Neth and find out how to decloak them, using some fancy technology. THey use it and find out, whoopsies, there’s A FLEET OUT THERE WATCHING THEM. They attack and then scramble, running away.</p>

<p>Neli just asked “is this episode Tuvok’s brain”. Uh oh. Tuvok is talking again, but he’s kind of kid-like. He has emotions, he doesn’t much care for logic and meditation. He’s also kind of angsty about what happened to him, understandably. They know that he got a cloaking frequency before being attacked, and they need it to find the aliens. He doesn’t remember though. He, and everyone else, are kinda upset at the fact that Tuvok isn’t really Tuvok anymore, and might never be again. Seven puts it eloquently. She changed, quite a lot. And she was helped, not by trying to force her back to what she was.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/1KZDkqM.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>I like this new Tuvok. He likes having fun. He likes smiling. He likes jazz. He ends up LOVING cooking, and specifically deserts. Why? Because “it tastes good”. Fair enough, man!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/CNNCJIG.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>He still can’t remember the cloaking frequency. But he writes it out on a cake he’s making.</p>

<p>They find the aliens, and the investigator they’re with makes a good offer. His device he made to find them, in exchange for the weapon they attacked Tuvok with so they can help Tuvok. They do it, and make a way to fix Tuvok.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/sp0hg9B.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Tuvok is not happy about this. He likes who he is NOW. He can enjoy things, and be with his best friend Neelix! He knows if he goes back to the way he was, he’ll probably just avoid Neelix again. “How will you know how much I enjoy your company?” “Well, you just told me”. AWWWW. That really gave me feels. Can you imagine if Tuvok just stayed like this for the entire series??? No obviously not, though he’s gone, he’s not gone FOREVER. Tuvok has a little less logic in him. Just a little less.</p>

<p><strong>Dragon’s Teeth</strong> - VOY
7/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/MWSH6y2.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We start IMMEDIATELY with a bombing of a city. Two aliens get in biopods to try and survive an attack. They’ll wake up 5 years later, and hopefully then the war will be over.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on Voyager, they’re in some wormhole. By accident. An alien ship inside tells them to get the fuck out, which they’re like “We’d love to but how” so they push them out. The aliens then go “Prepare to be boarded, we’re going to wipe your computer so you don’t have records of our space”. Janeway obviously ain’t gonna allow that, so they’re attacked, and they flee to a nearby planet that’s highly irradiated to try and escape. It works, but the aliens are still hovering above. Scans show that the entire planet became nuclear dust 892 years ago. That’s a bit more than 5 years.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/QoDpDnV.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They awaken one of them. The other is dead, her machine not functioning. Horrifying. He explains he’s a Vaadwaur. Things have changed a LOT. He knows of the Talax-ilzay, the predecessors of the Talaxians. He knows of the Borg, back when they were a small group. In the old Talaxian language btw, Vaudwar means “foolish”. I’m sure that’ll mean nothing. This guy, Gedrin, makes a suggestion. Wake up his batallion, help them off the planet, and he’ll help them through “underspace”, some wormhole tunnels that can lead them closer to his own.</p>

<p>They wake them up and work with them. Looks like this alliance will go well! Well, the first cracks that come up are actually with Naomi. She doesn’t like the Vaudwar kids. They called Neelix stupid, like all his race. Jerks &gt;:(</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/fB3ksWI.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Yeah turns out the Vaudwaur are empiralistic and awful. They promised to help Voyager get home faster. Now they refuse to unless given weapons. They want what was once their’s, and they’ll do whatever they can to get it. And their new plan is to kill the people on Voyager and take the ship as their own, with its superior technology. Yeah that’s a GREAT idea, Voyager, the only thing keeping you alive right now from the violent race that hates you upstairs.</p>

<p>Neelix and Seven study the Vaudwar and find what they used to be like. Janeway confronts the leader, the original one they released, Gedrin. He’s like “Well yeah we USED to be aggressive but not anymore!” My man, YOU’RE THE SAME EXACT PEOPLE. Not just descendants, the same people.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/BS77cbR.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This episode has a BUDGET. Janeway is prepared for them to be betrayed, and sure enough they are. They contact the aliens in orbit, old enemies of the Vaudwar, who are willing to help if they blow up the Vaudwar. They need to access a satellite though. Gedrin offers to help, as “not all of [his] people are stuck in the past”. He sacrifices himself so Voyager can escape. The rest of the Vaudwar are stuck fighting the Turei, the other aliens. Some Vaudwar manage to escape though and survive, so they’re still out there, and might become a threat… in STAR WARS ONLINE! Which isn’t canon but that’s okay.</p>

<p><strong>One Small Step</strong> - VOY
7/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/j0jejZB.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Weird-ass image for this episode, but its literally the first thing we see. We watch a NASA ship above Mars in the 21st century, as its suddenly confronted with some super large thing coming at it.</p>

<p>Now back on Voyager, some things are malfunctioning. Turns out it’s Seven’s fault. She’s like “I’m just upgrading the systems, it’s causing minor malfunctions”. “Seven that’s not up to you” “I will do it anyway” Seven we’ve had this conversation like eight times, where the hell is your character development. THen they get close to a “Graviton Elipse”, which the last time that was detected, it was a Mars mission that ended up stranding some people on Mars for weeks.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/2v3nXVQ.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They want to study it and get closer to it. Seven thinks they’re nuts. They think the NASA command center is in there, and find data from it, so they wanna go in and find it for themselves. Seven still thinks they’re nuts. She doesn’t understand this… “hero worship” or trying to make yourself a part of history. It’s highly illogical. Even TUVOK is into it. As he says, he IS a Starfleet officer. He’s here because he’s an explorer.</p>

<p>Tom, Seven, and Chakotay go into the Anomoly. Chakotay is so overwhelmed and excited by being in there, he wants to study everything they find in there. But they don’t have time, the anomaly is going to impact a dark matter asteroid and it’ll be Bad to be in there. But Chakotay is too up his own ass and doesn’t want to leave, so the impact happens and Chakotay gets shocked by a console in the Delta Flyer. The Flyer is damaged, they have two hours before it reaches subpsace, the engines are unsalvagable. That’s Bad.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/0idQrsz.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Seven is PISSED. Chakotay disobeyed orders and put everyone’s lives at risk. He SHOULD be court martialed, if he’s lucky. And by that I mean if WE’RE lucky. But nothing’s gonna happen to him, of course.</p>

<p>They send Seven over to the NASA shuttle to try and get some parts from it for salvage. They find some logs from the guy who disappeared into the anomaly. He did, in fact, survive. For a while. That’s fucking horrifying. This is a survival horror audio log. The rest of the episode is just them listening to this guy’s survival horror log as he dies. As he dies though, he makes a statement that it was right for them to come here, because he’s learned from all the debris out there that they’re not alone, and some day, someone might find the data he collected and learn from it.</p>

<p>They make it out, with his data and his corpse, and give him a proper sendoff. Seven now has a better appreciation of history and exploration.</p>

<p>So parts of this were great. All the stuff with the NASA survivor? Fantastic. Chakotay was annoying and bad as always, but we have a thing in our group called The Rule of Chakotay. Just cause Chakotay is in an episode and does something bad doesn’t make the entire episode bad, like how the Rule of Data means Data being good doesn’t mean the episode is neccesarily good.</p>

<p><strong>The Voyager Conspiracy</strong> - VOY
7/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/toBrgPO.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Seven is setting up a machine that’ll download information into her brain as she sleeps so she doesn’t have to study it like the primitives. I’m sure this won’t go wrong in any way. Hey remember that episode where Barclay downloaded so much information he became super smart or whatever? Anyway.</p>

<p>She wakes up and immediately calls Torres. I imagine this happens a lot after this episode. “TORRES, I DOWNLOADED INFORMATION LAST NIGHT. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF SKA?” This episode then goes into what is basically a Sherlock Holmes jump through what happened six weeks ago. She theorizes from some base information some bugs are making their nest in the ship’s computers, and yes, they are. So clearly this thing works.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/XABjX4v.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Voyager comes across an alien named Tash. He was stranded here years ago, and has been building a Super Catapult to throw him across space, basically. What a coincidence, WE want to be thrown across space! Voyager offers to help him fix his catapult if they can use it after he does, and they see it’s safe. He’s 100% down, just excited to be able to finish his catapult. Seven wakes up, and warns them. She thinks this is a trap. She believes the technology from the catapult is the same as the one that the Caretaker used to bring them here in the first place.</p>

<p>What proceeds is what I can only describe as a clipshow. I made a joke during that earlier episode with the Vaudwar that the budget was so inflated with CGI battles and shit that we’d be getting a clipshow later this season to pay for it, AND BEHOLD. Seven explains that she believes there’s a conspiracy going on, and goes over events that happened years ago. We see scenes and information from SEASONS ago. It’s done as well as it can be, but there’s really only one reason to reuse scenes in a Trek show, and that’s to save money. It’s why we’ve seen that Klingon ship from one of the early movies explode like 12 times by now.</p>

<p>After all her studying and thoughts, she believes that Janeway and Tuvok intentionally stranded everyone here in order to set up a military presence in the Delta Quadrant. Which goes against all of Janeway’s ideals, not to mention any amount of logic. If you were going to send a ship to establish a military presence in a far off region of space, why would you send Voyager, a rinky dink science vessel that’s exploded like a million times in different timelines???? Neli theorizes that this is something the writers saw people talking about in early internet forums and decided to make fun of. I agree. Our conspiracy theory is much funnire than Seven’s.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/FisaI1W.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This is Chakotay’s expression listening to Seven’s ludicrous screed. It’s fucking HILARIOUS. But the worst part is it seems he’s starting to fucking buy it??? Chakotay are you <strong><em>fucking kidding me????</em></strong> “Seven has some compelling evidence” NO SHE FUCKING DOES NOT. This is some “Photon torpedos won’t melt steel beams” shit.</p>

<p>Seven downloads more information, and then immediately calls Janeway. She believes now that Chakotay is planning a coup to restart the Maquis rebellion. Janeway is like “…..did Chakotay put you up to this what the fuck”. I think Seven’s just broken. Now Janeway and Chakotay assume each other, but they kind of ACCIDENTALLY let slip to each other they’re suspicious cause of stuff Seven has told them and then they’re like “wait this is stupid” just as Seven leaves in the Delta Flyer.</p>

<p>Janeway beams aboard to try and convince Seven to turn around, and she’s like “it’s no use, I know your TRUE REASON for being here! You came here to kidnap me!” She’s fucking broooooken. Janeway convinces her that she’s not here to hurt her, because she’s malfunctioning, and she cares about her. She gives examples of all the times she helped her and cared about her. It’s very straight.</p>

<p>I don’t THINK there were any Seven/Janeway shippers making this show, but I wouldn’t be that surprised.</p>

<p>Seven comes back, they fix her, and everything is good. They also use the catapult to get 3 years closer to home! Chakotay and Janeway joke about it. “You didn’t poison the coffee, did you?” “No more than usual.” This episode was stupid as fuck but honestly really funny.</p>

<p><strong>Pathfinder</strong> - VOY

<p>Holy shit it’s Barclay. Holy FUCK, it’s Troi! She looks so good in the modern outfit. It’s nice to see her! She’s visiting Barclay as the Enterprise is docked at Earth. Barclay is his usual nervous weird self. He’s been working on something called the “Pathfinder Project”, but he’s stopped working on it. Hints at things going wrong happen quickly. He has a cat! The cat’s name is Neelix. That’s probably not a coincidence. Barclay is afraid he’s becoming obsessed with Voyager.</p>

<p>He tells the story to Troi. He believed he could establish two way communication with Voyager, but Rej’s theories are… far fetched. You know that meme about Human engineers in Trek trying to turn the sun into a Torus? That’s Rej. He’s alienating himself from his friends and coworkers by obsessing with this. It’s mostly cause he wants to help the Voyager crew so much. He couldn’t sleep, he couldn’t focus on work, he once again got addicted to the holodeck, using a Voyager simulation that he invented based on info about Voyager.</p>

<p>It’s not ACCURATE information, and he’s practically using it as a second life MMO to live out a fantasy of helping these people and living on Voyager. Barclay is as uncomfortable and awkward to watch as he was on TNG. He makes an ass out of himself in front of Paris’ Admiral dad. He also tells Troi it’s totally NOT a relapse of his holo addiction, and she gives him a VERY funny “okay, sure” look. All of this gets him kicked off the project, and he wants Troi to tell the Admiral to put him back on the project, that he’s totally mentally fit to work. Troi refuses cause uh, he’s not. He’s unstable as fuck. He admits that a lot of this is because he’s no longer on the Enterprise. They were his family, now his family is Voyager. They’re all he has left.</p>

<p>He hacks his way into his work place later that night. He’s going to get the thing working so they can communicate with Voyager, if it’s the last thing he does. If he’s caught it WILL be.</p>

<p>Hey look, the thing! Barclay’s boss comes in and tries to stop him before Barclay can do… whatever he’s doing. So uh, everything explained here shows what Barclay is doing isn’t DANGEROUS or BAD. It is something that his boss has been pushing back against mostly out of frustration with Barclay being the way he is. They could just let Barclay do this for 20 minutes but whatever. Then there’d be no episode I guess. Rej is caught, and the program ends, after he ends a few messages.</p>

<p>Back on board the ACTUAL Voyager, Seven is trying to teach Neelix to sing, much to her chagrin. But then they get a message! Well, send one back!!</p>

<p>Back in Starfleet, Rej is about to be arrested (ironically, Admiral Paris actually was about to give permission for Barclay to do this, buuuuut he was a bit too impatient), but they’re interrupted by Janeway pushing through a message. Finally, Voyager has direct voice contact for the first time.</p>

<p>Paris hears that his son is there, and is an exemplary member of the crew. Not gonna mention he got demoted the other month, I guess. It looks like regular communication might happen. They also make Barclay, “whoever you are”, an honorary crew of Voyager. That’s cute.</p>

<p>Most of this episode was awkward and just okay, but the last bit was really good to see, after six seasons of build up, the emotional gut punch of them finally making voice contact.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="Voyager" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry></feed>
