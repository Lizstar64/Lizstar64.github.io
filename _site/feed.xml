<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p>IT’S BEEN A LOOOOONG ROOOOOAAAD</p>

<p><strong>Dead Stop</strong> - ENT
7/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/gBdeSD2.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This show REALLY likes continuity! I’m not used to that with Star Trek. Our last episode had the Enterprise almost blow the fuck up, an entire chunk taken out of the poor thing. They’re safe, but dead in the water. They can go maybe warp 2 if they push the thing, but that’s still 10 years before they reach Earth. Luckily a Tellerite freighter catches them and goes “We’re not close enough, but there’s a repair station at these coordinates”, 3 days away. First ever Tellerites since they showed up ONCE in TOS! We don’t really see them though, they just speak, and even then their voice is fuzzy cause they’re so far away.</p>

<p>They reach the repair station, which appears to be automated. Not very friendly or well explained, but surely this will turn out well and not be too good to be true! Everything inside is in English, the station having scanned them. A pleasant robot voice is like “please choose payment type” and “the recreation area is now available, please enjoy your visit”. The inside of this station reminds me of kids toys for some reason.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/7xAgzDY.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This ship has some very advanced technology, including replicators. This is before replicators were common place, though some species seem to have them at the very least. And whoever owns this repair station is VERY advanced. I know that the other foot is gonna drop and things are gonna be Bad here, but I’d kinda like if this was just watching them get excited about advanced technology.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/BLCrA2T.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Holy shit, it’s a fucking exocomp on its side. AN EXOCOMP, AS SEEN FROM ABOVE!! Making good use of old props they had lying around. Nanmo lives on EVEN NOW, like 12 years after anyone stopped caring about Dirty Pair.</p>

<p>Anyways, it all seems too good to be true, and Archer is the one really feeling this. Though tbf Reed and Trip are also sus and go sneaking around in the station’s cracks and crannies, and it teleports them off it. Mayweather is called by Archer somewhere and theeeen is suddenly killed. Rest in peace, Mayweather. No one knows why the fuck Mayweather went to a cordoned off area, it makes no sense. This is actually their first ever death. I can’t BELIEVE they’ve dodged so many deaths. They are really, REALLY hammering this in. This is like 10 minutes of them being sad about Mayweather’s death.</p>

<p>Obviously no, Mayweather’s not dead. It kidnapped him, replicated a fake dead body, and hoped they wouldn’t notice they just took one of their people and put them into slavery. So now they need to save him. While Trip distracts the program by huckstering it, the others sneak inside and try not to step off the alarm this time.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Ek7HENE.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Turns out it kidnaps aliens and then hooks them into the computer to use their body as processing power. I feel there’s easier ways to have a functioning computer like this… but whatever you say, random super powerful aliens we’ll never see or find out about. Maybe the writer had just seen The Matrix, it was pretty recent. They set off explosions in the warp plasma they were giving to the station. The station claims down on them but they manage to escape as it explodes. All those other aliens in there? They are VERY dead. But as they fly off… the station starts repairing itself. Oops we created the Borg. Too bad we’ll never see anything about this ever again.</p>

<p>This one was alright.</p>

<p><strong>A Night in Sickbay</strong> - ENT
1/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Km5ejJt.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>You know, I didn’t know very much about Enterprise before watching this show. But the one thing I DID know is that it had a lot of decon scenes with half naked actors rubbing gel on each other. There’s been a lot less of it then I thought there’d be. But this is the one I’ve been waiting for.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/mFGysyU.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Archer rubbing gel all over Porthos.</p>

<p>You rememebr the Kreetassans? Prolly not. They were the aliens who got super offended cause Humans eat in public. Archer needed something from them so he groveled for 5 days, got another chance at an embassy, and immediately got kicked off the planet agian. Why? Cause he took Porthos and Porthos pissed on some of their sacred trees. Why the fuck did Archer bring Porthos to this diplomatic meeting? I guess he just assumed that the cute little Dog would make things go better.</p>

<p>Anyways they Kreetassans didn’t really try hard enough to make sure whether their planet was safe for Dogs, so it’s not. After Archer finds out that they might have killed his dog, he goes “They better HOPE they didn’t kill my dog, because if they did, I’ll be the one pissing on their trees”</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/NTtzhdt.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Captain Archer, the first Captain in Starfleet history, one of the most historically important Humans ever, threatens to piss on some sacred trees out of anger.</p>

<p>Archer decides to spend the night in Medbay. Turns out Phlox is a very bad roommate. He’s cutting his nails and scraping his tongue in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>Archer’s being a little brat this episode. Yes I know his dog might die, and that’s very exhausting and emotionally a lot, but he really is being a fucking whiny bitch about the whole thing. I’ve often said that Enterprise is the most American Star Trek. It was mostly post 9/11 and has a lot of American jingoism and ideals baked into its writing and nature as American bullshittery reached a height. It is VERY America centric. But I think NOTHING shows how America centric this show is more than how Archer is acting in this episode. He’s being a fucking whiny bitch about needing to bend over backwards to fit in with some other aliens’ culture, when they SHOULD just bend over to HIS culture. And the Kreetassans are shown as extremely rude, self centered, and awful. So this episode 100% thinks Archer is in the right about this. I don’t care if it ends with him actually sucking up and doing the thing, the vibes are just off. Just compare how Archer is whining about needing to do some rituals to apologize for pissing them off to how Picard would act in TNG. I’m PRETTY sure I remember an episode where Picard learned an aliens’ language and did like a 2 hour long ritual just to make them feel welcome and they went “you really didn’t need to do all that”. THAT is how a captain acts. Not THIS. This alone is knocking Archer down several knocks on my tier list.</p>

<p>I’m kind of hating this episode but Phlox is fun in it at least. He has a lot of good moments. Him scraping his tongue. Him messing with a bat that sprays liquid all over him, and when Archer goes “is that dangerous?” he licks it and goes “Eh, probably not”.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/CseI4Vg.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Anyways Archer APPEARS to be really low on sleep and is having a lot of weird dreams about being sexually attracted to T’Pol, and it’s so awkward and uncomfortable. I think I hate this episode. It promised to be about ARcher’s love for his dog but then it’s filled with weird slapstick that has nothing to do with anything, Archer being VERY annoying, and then this. Star Trek often does romance awkwardly, and I KNEW they’d push a T’Pol x Archer pairing as like, the main canon pairing for this series, but for fucks sake, I was REALLY hoping they’d get it started with something BETTER THAN THIS. He even goes “I’m doing the breast I can- I mean the best”. This was written by a fucking hack. OH, WRITTEN BY RICK BERMAN? I’M FUCKING STUNNED. This has the energy of a really awkwardly horny, bad anime you watch 2 episodes of and then stop watching. This episode reminds me of DNA Squared. And that is a REALLY bad thing.</p>

<p>Even Phlox being cool and doing good lore doesn’t help with this. I’m learning a LOT about Dunobulans, and they’re all cool. I like Dunobulans, and I like Phlox. But I really can’t get over Archer in this episode, who frankly has been racist, and he does actually apologize for being racist and not understanding other cultures, but to me it’s a bit too little too late.</p>

<p>At least T’Pol straight up goes “you are my superior officer so we will never be a thing, have a nice day”. IT is as awkward as you can imagine it is. Anyways they get their thing and Porthos is fine. Fuck this episode.</p>

<p><strong>Marauders</strong> - ENT
5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/RDgTCvo.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Enterprise lands at a Deuterium mining facility and offers to buy some  The people at the mining facility are ragged and anxious and extremely unhappy about anyone wanting to buy their deuterium being here, but they agree to sell some for a pretty harsh deal, and if they give some med supplies, AND if they fix some broken pumps. They’re evasive about everything. Trip meets a kid while working on stuff and makes friends with him.</p>

<p>We find what the problem is pretty fast. Some Klingons are on their way, and they get VERY grumpy because they think they have… a “mutual arrangement”. The Klingons don’t notice the Humans but beat the shit out of the settlers anyway, cause why the fuck not? They don’t have the Deuterium they want, even though they’re there early, so they beat them up for the “disrepect”. You know, bad Klingon stuff.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/82AhGdD.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The leader of the colony just wants the Humans to leave, it’s not their fault, but everyone wants to help. They need to do SOMETHING, so they decide to teach them how to defend themselves. They eventually agree to help once Archer gives ‘em the old “teach a man to fish” line, which I have NO idea why that worked. They have 3 days. Time to montage.</p>

<p>We get them planning out traps, teaching guns, and martial arts. There’s a scene where T’Pol is like “I will teach you an ancient Vulcan technique”. That technique is getting the fuck out of the way.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/lDND4mm.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We then Bugs Life these grasshoppers. T’Pol even gets a scene where she beats the shit out of a Klingon in hand to hand combat. Berman must have been asleep. They successfully get the Klingons into the trap, and they go “HMPH, WELL WE DIDN’T WANT YOUR STUPID DEUTERIUM ANYWAY, YOU DOO DOO FACE!” and leave. It goes almost comically, sappily well. Even the kid lives. Trip gives him some schematics for the Enterprise, and all’s well that ends well. Frankly I’m stunned the Klingons didn’t bombard the colony from space out of spite.</p>

<p>This is, I believe, the first time we really fight Klingons. This kind of story is a little boring, and this is a very standard retelling of that idea.</p>

<p><strong>The Seventh</strong> - ENT
3/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/y7x25Ej.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>T’Pol is contacted the be High Command who say they’ve found someone named Menos. T’Pol then goes to Archer and is VERY out of character. She’s talking kinda stilted and awkwardly, and looks VERY unhappy, and tells him that she needs to do a mission and cannot tell him more. Archer is very bratty about this, as he usually is. When she comes to him and goes “I need your help” he’s EXTRA bratty. Archer, please.</p>

<p>She explains that she used to be a part of Vulcan security. There was a team of Vulcan spies who went rogue basically, years ago, and T’Pol could not apprehend one of them. They found him now, and she wants Archer to help her. He’s still bratty like “Pff, why ME?” and she’s like “Because I want to be with someone I can trust”, cutting it right to the bone. Get his ass, T’Pol.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Br9g5Up.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Trip is really excited to be acting captain while Archer is off the ship… at first. He uses Archer’s room to relax, eats nice food prepared specially for him. But then he has to make DECISIONS. AND the Admiral is currently asking for Archer, who was NOT supposed to go on the mission but did anyway. So Trip just…. freezes. And refuses to make any decisions. He is NOT made for captaining. He just pushes it down the way. I regretably relate to it, but I hate that I relate to Trip, cause he has big Rick Berman Self Insert character energy. Also, Trip is uh, a high ranking officer? He was 2nd in command until T’Pol came in. He trained for this. And here he is being a baby.</p>

<p>They capture their guy, who’s a Vulcan but has been surgically changed to look like a not Vulcan. He claims he’s not a villain, they just want to take him back because he decided he liked the life he’s living here. 
He doesn’t smuggle weapons like the reports say, he just didn’t want to go back home… which is technically against the law for an agent to do, so they’re trying to bring him back, and he’ll be tried guilty. “But the government wouldn’t do that!” Archer says, as if he didn’t find the Vulcans breaking a fucking treaty like a couple months ago and cause a diplomatic incident.</p>

<p>T’Pol is acting very weird. She’s remembering some things, their guy thinks she’s gonna kill him, and she’s acting very emotional.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/iAd3zwf.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Turns out she killed this guy’s partner years ago, then they did a Vulcan ritual on her that made her forget her memories and the emotions of the act, since killing others fucked her up a looot. Especially if he’s innocent, which he sure does claim he is. I mean, the guy she killed LOOKED like he was reaching for his gun. But also who knows. We can’t trust him, but we also can’t trust the high command, though Archer keeps saying we should. Dude.</p>

<p>This is very sloppily handled PTSD. Anyways he’s even more hard to trust when he sets the fucking bar they’re in on fire and runs away. He manages to get the drop on them, but Archer almost kills T’Pol to get into a fire fight.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/uila8Sl.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>He tries to play to her guilty again, and Archer is like “You were here to apprehend him, not judge him”. Anyways it turns out he IS smuggling illegal biotoxins! We were justified! Never question orders :D</p>

<p>Rick Berman is a shitty writer, more news at 11. Brannon Braga is not much better.</p>

<p><strong>The Communicator</strong> - ENT
3.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/CSRXflL.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Reed, Hoshi, and Archer were exploring a pre-warp civilization. I want to note, Neli went “Oh good, he took competent people with him this time”. We then find out Reed just fucking forgot his communicator and left it down on the planet. Well so much for that!</p>

<p>They’re acting like this is a big deal. It is, of course, leaving technology behind in a prewar civilization is very bad. But can’t you like, call it to find out where it is and then teleport it back? You have teleporters. Fucking use them.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/b35NGff.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>THey go back to the bar, get their communicator, and are immediately captured by some fascist-coded secret police. Welp, so much contamination of this prewarp civilization. This is why we probably shouldn’t just go down to them willy nilly, and when we do, WE SHOULDN’T MISPLACE OUR BELONGINGS.</p>

<p>I’m starting to agree with the Vulcans. They shouldn’t be out here. And frankly, that’s insulting to me, because the Vulcans in this show are fucking pretentious smug fuckheads and I hate them. But they’re right, and its the worst.</p>

<p>Half this show is Archer getting stuck in a chair and getting the shit beat out of him. It happens a lot. Anyways the secret police believe that Archer and Reed are here to assassinate Hitler, I mean Chancellor Kultarey. But when they beat the shit out of them, it becomes clear that the things on their foreheads are fake, and their blood is red. Oops, we made it worse.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/m7uidcS.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Trip plans to use the Suleban cloak ship that they have from when they rescued Klaang… what? You still have that? It’s been A YEAR, dude. That’s just been sitting there?? Anyways he tries to get it working and then gets hit with a wave of energy which makes his arm cloaked. Trip sucks the fun out of everything, this should be a goofy fun scene. But I hate it.</p>

<p>The fascists are like “There’s no other option. These are space aliens.” Archer is like “That’s nuts. Come on, we’re just super soldier prototypes. Y’all are nuts.” Well, he helped hold back the cultural corruption, at least.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/sALSyut.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Archer and Reed are about to be executed and dissected, and they had a long talk about “It’s good that the Enterprise is leaving us to die so we don’t make things worse down here”. And then their execution is interrupted by them showing up, cloaked, blasting, and then fleeing. Archer even goes to grab the weapons. There’s even a little “Ha ha, looking for this?” moment with Reed like “ha ha, you almost forgot your communicator”. Ha ha, we escalated a war that will kill millions.</p>

<p>T’Pol makes it clear, they fucked up, really, really bad. But she’s at least proud that Archer was going to sacrifice his life to protect them from more contamination… which is something.</p>

<p>Eh, no. Mostly annoying. Use the fucking transporter, or at least tell me there’s Fucktonium in the way. It’s good to show why the Prime Directive is important, Rick Berman is not that good of a writer.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="Enterprise" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 193</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/10/23/OOCY193.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 193" /><published>2025-10-23T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-10-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/10/23/OOCY193</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/10/23/OOCY193.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/DEEgQAE.png" alt="'" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>This was a biiiiig one.</p>

<p>I like Sudoku quite a bit. Half a decade ago, I was in a really bad spot, and sudoku was one of the only things I could do to distract myself and calm myself down. I haven’t done much sudoku since then, but when this set came out, I decided I’d give it a try. This is Luca no Puzzle de Daibouken, a Gameboy Color game with a LOT of Sudoku puzzles on it. How many? 200.</p>

<p>I know the title screen says “2” by the way. I dunno why. It’s not the second.</p>

<p>The game has three modes. The first is 100 puzzles, each 20 of which unlock a new mini game in the mini game mode. These save and note as being beaten. After you beat all 100, you unlock 100 MORE puzzles. These are not the same puzzles but like, there’s nothing differentiating them basically. The ONLY difference is you can’t save in the middle of a puzzle, like in the other mode for some reason.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/183cTu6.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Other than that, it sure is sudoku! It’s got a cute energy and alright music. I like the ocean and dolphins are adorable. There’s one problem, though. See this cute screen with all the fish in the background? Well yes, that’s the only screen for 200 puzzles, but most importantly, those numbers are WAY too small for me to read. Luckily, the game has a zoom in feature to make the entire screen the puzzle. But that also means… what’s the point. It’s JUST sudoku at that point.</p>

<p>I did 4 puzzles every day for months. It was very calming and pleasant for a while, just starting every stream with an hour and a half of sudoku. By the end I was ready to be done with it, to be honest. It was like 170 hours of fucking Sudoku. Even for someone who likes it, that’s a lot.</p>

<p>At least the dolphin is cute, though.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Gameboy" /><category term="Obscure Games" /><category term="Puzzles" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 192</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/10/22/OOCY192.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 192" /><published>2025-10-22T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-10-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/10/22/OOCY192</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/10/22/OOCY192.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/NW2CVsj.png" alt="'" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p>IT’S BEEN A LOOOOONG ROOOOOAAAD</p>

<p>(these were 5 episodes from last week, and now 2 episodes to finish the season)</p>

<p><strong>Detained</strong> - ENT
8/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/rpEEFIb.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Mayweather wakes to find he’s in some kind of jail filled with Suliban. Holy shit, a Mayweather episode?! No way- oh, he’s here with the captain. Damn, okay, nevermind.</p>

<p>They’re taken to the warden who’s like “we found your shuttle near our military installation, and almost blew you up”. It was an honest misunderstanding, they were just studying the weird energy readings they found on it. No one is happy about this, but hey, it is what it is. Their hearing will be in 3 days and it should be fast. All they need to do is survive in the detention center for 3 days which is filled with Suliban POWs. Oh boy!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/X3usRWW.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Oh, maybe not POWs. That’s a child. Archer is like “Wtf you’re using KIDS for your war??” and he’s like “what the fuck no. You don’t know anything about us” and then he’s caught outside of curfew and is mistreated by the guards. Oh boy!!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/igoh5oa.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Archer finds the guy later and is like “Hey please tell me wtf is going on cause CLEARLY the Tandarens gave us a very biased viewpoint”. The Cabal attacked them 8 years ago, and the Tandarens put all the Suliban in their territory into internment camps. He thanks Archer for even listening, cause no one else will even bother. Archer is then taken to the leader of the internment camp, who WAS very friendly, but he’s not so much now that he knows Archer is talking to Suliban, AND he knows Archer knows things about Suliban. He threatens to keep him here indefinetely, and Archer is not at ALL willing to tell him anything cause holy shit, internment camps are evil, DID YOU KNOW THAT?</p>

<p>Good thing this is just fiction.</p>

<p>The Enterprise comes and is ready to sneak Archer and Mayweather out, but Archer refuses. Why? He’s going to save the Suliban, of course. He HAMMERS the fucking point by telling T’Pol about Japanese internment camps. Look, you need to be blunt for some topics. And this is one of em, I’m fine with it. It’s also VERY funny to me that they’re talking about this and how heinous it is, literally RIGHT when 9/11 happened and Freedom Fries were about to become a thing.</p>

<p>It IS unfortunate that we have ONE character in the Suliban group who’s a racist who hates the Humans cause they kinda look liek Tandarens. There’s racism on BOTH sides!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/aVh4xId.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Reed beams down disguised as a Sulliban, while Trip goes in guns fucking blazing. It’s time for a prison break!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ETPmZrO.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Nice line. The general is like “THESE PEOPLE HAVE NO RIGHTS, AND YOU JUST GAVE THEM 80 MORE SOLDIERS! THEY’LL JOIN THE CABAL CAUSE WE TREATED THEM SO BAD”. Gee I WONDER WHY THEY’D DO THAT? But no, Archer is like “You’re a fucking idiot”. He doesn’t even talk to the Suliban as they blast off, they just go their seperate ways, with Archer going “I think they’ll be alright”.</p>

<p>A little on the noise, but this one was good.</p>

<p>The Enterprise insults some aliens in first contact and they run off. But not before some kind of goo moves from their ship to the Enterprise…</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/zgoSEBv.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Alex Mack is invading Enterprise!! Oh no!</p>

<p>We find out that Archer’s favorite sport, that he’s obsessed with, is water polo. That’s so fucking funny.</p>

<p>Anyways Alex Mack is causing some tech fuckery. Power’s going out, screens are showing the wrong thing. An engineer goes to figure out why the lights went out on D Deck and finds milk, goop, and webbing. And instead of immediately leaving he just keeps investigating. Dude.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/WAiKrm8.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Everyone goes to investigate and finds the crewmen in a web of some kind. You know, I just watched Alien. Anyways, it captures Trip and the Captain, and Reed has to run away, not before severing one of its tentacles. Phlox studies it and believes it MIGHT be intelligent. But they need to save those people so let’s go in blasting. Unfortunately, the alien has connected with their nervous systems so any amount of damage they do to it will hurt them. Apparently they’re all morphing into one creature in there. Weird.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/FXanqFY.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Hoshi and T’Pol are working together to learn its language, which is almost math-like. Just fucking kiss, you two.</p>

<p>Very good scene between Reed and Phlox. Reed is going to torture the organism’s apendage that they cut off, and Phlox is like “No, it shows signs of being intelligent life”. “Who cares? It might hurt the captain” “I don’t care”. While I agree with Phlox over Reed, obviously, this is a good character moment for both of them. Reed is a lot more pragmatic. Phlox not so much.</p>

<p>They find the aliens who stormed off earlier, who are like “oh yes, we were at that creatures’ homeworld, sorry. But first, apologize. You ate in public which is very rude to us”. Merriweather apologizes but is kinda bad with it. Come on man, its not THAT hard to believe that they have a cultural tabboo about this.</p>

<p>Reed basically has to invent forcefields to try and get in so they can communicate with this thing. Kinda rude of the Vulcans to not teach them about forcefields though.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/PiIMm8Z.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The creature sounds like its rubbing a bunch of balloons together. They communicate with it, tell it they’ll take it home, and it releases the Humans from its clutches. They take it to its homeworld, and alls good. It’s cute.</p>

<p><strong>Fallen Hero</strong> - ENT
7.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/hip69J8.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This episode starts in the most nutso way. T’Pol asks Archer if the Humans on Enterprise are getting enough sex. He’s like “what the FUCK?” “Well, I hear it eases tension for Humans.” To which Trip responds with “Not in MY experience”. Trip. Did you… just admit to being bad at sex??</p>

<p>Before they can go get laid though, they’re interrupted with orders to go pick up a Vulcan from a nearby planet. They HAVE to, NOW, then deliver her to a ship thats on its way in 3 days. She’s a famous ambassador. That’s all we know.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/cH1jNcR.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We find out fast that she’s being expelled for illegal activities. We don’t know what THAT is, but we’re still trying to be friendly and understanding. She’s SHOCKINGLY friendly for a Vulcan. She shakes hands, tries to understand Human culture, and is an ACTUALLY GOOD VULCAN ON EARLY ENTERPRISE. All the other Vulcans are weird assholes, she’s very friendly and understanding. But she IS an ambassador, this is how she SHOULD act. Though she’s also a criminal. T’Pol is extremely disappointed in her, and can’t hide her emotions about it.</p>

<p>They’re intercepted by a ship that’s like “Hi we’re here to take the ambassador back :)” and when Archer realizes he’s sus, they start opening fire. Enterprise is damaged but manages to run away.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/4GW6cF4.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/rxxhIzc.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Archer orders the ship to go back when the ambassador refuses to tell them wtf is going on. Vulcans are going to get VERY angry about this, but you know how he is with Vulcans. T’Pol and the ambassador have a talk about it. V’lar, the ambassador, is a very weird Vulcan. Her acting is different than any Vulcan I’ve seen.</p>

<p>She convinces T’Pol that it’s IMPERETIVE she not be sent back or she’ll be killed. Archer is still like “not enough” but when T’Pol BEGS, he relents.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/k81xThC.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>To escape the attacks, they push the engines further than they’ve ever been pushed. The Ambassador is like “Alright fuck this, give me to them, it’s not worth you all dying” but Archer was given orders so he’ll carry them out. He’s an honorable dude even if he’s grumpy at times. The Vulcan Ambassador wasn’t sure if she could trust Humans, but she finds them fascinating… But Archer’s gonna show why he’s out here.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/jQgqTXC.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Vulcan ships are very cool.</p>

<p>Anyways they get boarded and just have to buy ten minutes for the other ship to show up, so they pretend she gets put in the med bay, and they “kill her” (it’s a fake). Ha ha, gottem.</p>

<p>She announces that T’Pol and Archer seem to have a good burgeoning friendship, which poses well for their people, and then steps out. This episode was good too! Damn, good night tonight.</p>

<p><strong>Desert Crossing</strong> - ENT
6/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/yHx0ruE.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Enterprise is STILL heading to Risa when they’re interrupted by a distress call. They save Clancy Brown who sounds VERY Lex Luthory.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/J7qHn7V.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>He invites Archer to a party on his planet. It’s a desert planet, and they don’t really WANT to but they don’t want to offend him. MAybe they should invite the Vulcan, she’s from a desert planet- oh, no, Trip? Okay. Why not.</p>

<p>Trip and Archer have a good time. Eating blood soup and testicals, and playing Desert Lacross. It’s a very Top Gun scene. Everything seems good, but then T’Pol is contacted by a government official who’s like “you’re in danger. That man is a terrorist”. Uh oh.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/dV79Pay.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>When they find out, their host is like “Look, you’re being lied to.” They’re a lower class culture in this society and are being mistreated, and after ten years of trying to do it legally through protests and courts, are now attacking them and resorting to terrorism. “They call us TERRORISTS!” No, dog. You ARE a terrorist. Like, that’s the definition of it. You may in the right, but that doesn’t matter. It’s still terrorism.</p>

<p>Archer doesn’t handle this well. He was led here under false pretenses, and this guy wants him to help them fight a war. And why? Because he heard about Archer from the Suliban he released. A made up fictitious account that’s blown out of proportion, mind you. If there’s one good thing about Enterprise, they’re good at continuity. Anything can relate to anything else.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/HosUVri.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The place they’re being kept at is being attacked, and they decide they’ll be safer in the desert. That seems…. I dunno. Deserts are scary. It doesn’t go well, especially since there’s also shuttles out looking for them, because the government has just decided they’re collaborating with the terrorists.</p>

<p>This episode has the longest unbroken shot in the entirety of the Star Trek franchise. Trip and Archer are hiding in an old abandoned shack, and Archer is trying to keep Trip awake so he doesn’t pass out with heat stroke, cause that’s bad for you. Almost four straight minutes of them acting tired and dying.</p>

<p>With the help of the original guy who got us into this mess, they manage to sneak a shuttle down to the planet and rescue the two of them. The episode ends with Archer admitting his cause is worth fighting for, but that’s not why they’re out there, and they go their seperate ways.</p>

<p><strong>Two Days and Two Nights</strong> - ENT
7.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/cigexKX.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Part three of the Journey to Risa trilogy, no joke, that’s what Memory Alpha says. But they FINALLY made it to Risa and are gonna be vacationing for two days. Archer is kinda unhappy he’s vacationing, but T’Pol is basically forcing him to. Plus they all drew lots. He needs a vacation. Thankfully, nothing bad is gonna happen at all while he’s down there! And back on Enterprise, Plox is starting his hibernation. Ohhh, let’s just STACK the Dangerous Situations on top of each other! Luckily, Archer is going down with Porthos in the shuttle, so we know nothings gonna happen to him. They’ll NEVER endanger Porthos.</p>

<p>I know this isn’t going to happen but please just let this be them chilling on the planet.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/npy9zfG.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>T’Pol gifts Archer a copy of the teachings of Surak to “relax”, which is VERY funny. He also sees a girl with a dog in a villa across the way. Ooooh, romaaaance?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/NSV9Ki0.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Speaking of romance, we gotta keep pretending Reed is straight so he and Trip (who is actually straight, way, way too straight) standing around in a bar creepily oggling women. There’s jokes about “is that even a woman” which oh, what fun. Meanwhile Hoshi meets an alien with a weird language, and he offers to help her learn some of it. Okay, calling it. Hoshi is fucking that alien. Archer is MAYBE gonna fuck the girl he’s with, but might decide he would want something deeper. And Reed and Trip are going to desperately attempt to get laid but will absolutely not.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/v2t7Yb9.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Oh nevermind, they’ll just get robbed by some shapeshifters pretending to be call girls looking for sex. Why are they introducing so many shapeshifters?? I feel like this could create some problems for the lore.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/sbrkpTP.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Mayweather gets injured and has an allergic reaction to the medicine so they have to wake Phlox up. Phlox when he’s not gotten enough sleep acts like he’s drunk, and it’s actually VERY funny. He’s calling everyone captain, stumbling around, going “WE NEED BLOOD WORMS, MAXIMUM WARP”, it’s great.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/0Ofjb3b.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Archer’s new girlfriend is very VERY insistant that Archer knows info about the Cabal. Archer is sus and scans her, turns out she’s a Tandaran. He assumes Grat, the Tandaran from that earlier episode, sent her. She knocks him out with a Spy Weapon, says she can’t have him “interfere”, and then leaves. They all make it back to the ship, Hoshi having gotten laid, Trip and Reed covered in gunk and exhausted from having to break out of bonds, and Archer pensive. And it just ends. PRetty good over all. A  bit glad it didn’t move into some greater bigger plot thread.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/uQBARBa.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>While visiting a mining colony, they visit in a shuttle. The atmosphere is filled with shit that can explode, so they turn off their plasma ducts. Uh, but the atmosphere fucking explodes anyway. The entire colony is wiped out. 3600 colonists, dead. Everything shows that their stuff didn’t malfunction, but that doesn’t change the fact that there’s a bunch of dead people down there. They followed the protocols, hell they went above and beyond, but that doesn’t help either.</p>

<p>T’Pol is like “He is acting illogical” because Archer is EXTREMELY upset and blames himself for all thsoe deaths. Phlox is like “are you fucking kidding me”. Archer gets orders to go back home, the mission is cancelled. The Vulcans will use this as an excuse to delay Humans for another 20-30 years. Archer’s just letting it happen.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/qxdN6Mu.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>T’Pol is the person who knocks Archer out of his dispondency. It works because a VULCAN of all people is going “No, you Humans are ready. I’ll talk to my people. Will you talk to your’s?”. And then, when he goes to bed… he suddenly finds himself in the past. He’s EXTREMELY sus. Everything is EXACTLY how it was just before he boarded Enterprise, just before the first episode.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/KESlahx.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Hey look, it’s Daniels! Remember him? He was fucking killed. That hasn’t changed. He’s like “Yeah that DID happen but hey, I’m fine now. Let’s not make a big deal out of this.” He took Archer back into the past so that he could tell him exactly what happened. Archer gets a crash course in temporal techno babble, and when he gets back to the present, he knows EXACTLY how to prove they’re innocent. Whoever temporally fucked with the timeline made it seem like Enterprise killed a bunch of people to try and get them out of the picture.</p>

<p>Archer then goes a mile a minute telling everyone EXACTLY how to fix things. No one questions things cause they trust him, but they’re all visibly weirded out. They raid a Suliban stealth cruiser and get proof that they’re innocent, and that it was the Suliban who did all this.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/WYKiNDT.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Silik is still talking to this random shadowy dude, which is very, VERY Star Wars still but whatever. I sure hope we found out what thats all about soon :)</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/7yBCzT1.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>On their way home, they find themselves surrounded by cloaked meatballs. Silik says “come with me or I blow everyone up”. Archer puts T’Pol in command, and goes with him. Archer basically does the Sisko “I’m going, but I’m not gone. I’ll be back soon” thing. But not quite as effective. He goes… and then disappears. No one knows where he went. Silik is not impressed, and orders Enterprise blown up.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ThylDMW.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Daniels grabbed Archer and took him to the 31st centry, like his bosses told him to. But uh… turns out that was a Bad Idea, and now the ENTIRE FUTURE IS DEAD because of this. And there’s no way to get back. They’re stranded. The End.</p>

<p>CLIFF HANGER TIME!</p>

<p>Interesting setup for a 2 parter. Let’s hope it ends well. I also wish I gave more of a shit about the Temporal Cold War.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="Enterprise" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">LizstarTrek - Enterprise Season 2 episodes 1 - 5</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/lizstartrek/2025/10/19/LizstartrekEnt2-1.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="LizstarTrek - Enterprise Season 2 episodes 1 - 5" /><published>2025-10-19T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-10-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/lizstartrek/2025/10/19/LizstartrekEnt2-1</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/lizstartrek/2025/10/19/LizstartrekEnt2-1.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ouHMzRZ.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p>IT’S BEEN A LOOOOONG ROOOOOAAAD</p>

<p><strong>Shockwave Part 2</strong> - ENT
6/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/BHbF1JO.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Daniels is NOT handling his world being blown up very well. Why do all these time travel cops snap and break the SECOND something bad happened with time travel? You’d think they’d be PREPARED for this shit. Remember the guy from Voyager who became a screaming raving hobo telling everyone about time travel after being stranded in the past? Idiots.</p>

<p>Enterprise is taken by the Suliban, who’re holding everyone hostage while they’re searching for Archer. Trip tries to fight them even thoguh they have guns on him and say “we will kill people if you resist”. I think I’ve realized what Trip reminds me of. He’s like a Chihuaha in a Human body. He yaps angrily at everything even though he knows it’ll do nothing and gets himself into danger trying to fight people he has no chance or hurting.</p>

<p>“We learned how to do time travel in high school” says Daniels. Why? Why did you do that? That seems very, very bad.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/CnHX1Zm.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Rick Berman, I’m gonna NEED you to keep your fucking “tie a woman up and torture her” fetish out of Star Trek for one fucking show, please, I FUCKING beg of you.</p>

<p>This is not beating the “part 2s are usually worse than the 1st part” allegations.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/WqR5MD0.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>T’Pol is drugged out of her mind, when Archer manages to communicate with her. He’s doing a big Wizard of Oz thing with her, and needs her help, but she’s VERY zonked. But next time we see her she’s fine and working towards helping so I guess we’ll just forget that. Wow, there was no reason to have that “drug T’Pol and torture her” scene from earlier? No way! Rick Berman should be arrested.</p>

<p>They then force Hoshi to sneak through the shafts in a tanktop. Usually I’d love an episode of people Die Harding through the space ship, but this has the stink of Horny Berman all over it, as Hoshi moans her way through the engineering shafts, freaking out cause of claustrophobia. It’s way, WAY too Horny. And then she rips her shirt and gets naked. Rick Berman should be tried for war crimes.</p>

<p>Do you remember how Vulcans are super physically strong? Anyways cause T’Pol is a weak little girl she’s used as bait and dragged off easily by two big strong men. Rick Berman should be executed for war crimes.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/b8ZUkM5.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Reed is captured while trying to take soemthing from Daniels’ locker, as the Humans sabatoge the warp core and prepare the ship to blow the fuck up. The Suliban take the thing from Reed but run away. Turns out they just faked a warp core explosion to get control back. Meanwhile, Silik is trying to use the thing he took from Reed to talk to Emperor Palpatine, and then turns out OH NO, IT’S ACTUALLY ARCHER, who jumps through time and decks him in the fucking face.</p>

<p>Archer takes Silik hostage and returns. Ambassador Soval, the Vulcan ambassador, still is like “You are a menace to this quadrant and must be stopped, I don’t care if you’re innocent”. Why did they assign an ambassador to Earth who CLEARLY hates Humans? Anyways, T’Pol speaks up and calls him out, defending Archer. Her speaking up STUNS everyone, and is probably what saved it. Enterprise continues.</p>

<p>Neli: “Okay. I didn’t hate the moments that weren’t offensive”</p>

<p>I couldn’t say it better myself. Good concepts and fun moments, especially the T’Pol bit at the end, is quite good. And then Berman’s spunk is all OVER this from him masturbating to it.</p>

<p><strong>Carbon Creek</strong> - ENT
10/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ouHMzRZ.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Trip, Archer, and T’Pol are celebrating her being on the ship for a full year. Impressive since the last longest time serving on a Human ship was 10 days. While having dinner, Archer asks why T’Pol was visiting Carbon Creek, a random mining town in Pennsylvania in 1957. She tells the story, and it becomes a Story Episode of her tlaking about her ancestors who crash landed on Earth hundreds of years ago. Her great grandmother, specifically. Her Gram Gram, T’Mir, is played by T’Pol’s actor, a classic just like when Voyager did it with Janeway’s ancestor. The seed is strong, I suppose.</p>

<p>Anyways T’Mir and another Vulcan go into town, steal some clothes, and try to blend in, just to try and get food, cause they’ll starve otherwise. They’re bad at blending in but it’s basically just two nerds with autism. Now it IS 1957, but people are taking it generally in stride. At least neither of the Vulcans are black, could you imagine?</p>

<p>T’Mir’s associate, Mestral, gambles on Pool and gets them some food. Trip feels like this is something out of the Twilight Zone but I’m kinda digging it so far. They get some odd jobs around town. T’Mir is annoyed at the situation, wants to avoid Humans, and thinks they’ll just blow each other up. Mestral appreciates the Humans, thinks them full of empathy and compassion, and expects they’ll do great things in the future. He’s also kind of a Humaboo, and is a fan of I Love Lucy. Also fun since I Love Lucy is so integral to Star Trek existing, its a cute reference.</p>

<p>Mestral also has very big Data vibes. This actor totally watched some Brent Spiner before this.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Qpew3Hn.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Anyways turns out Mestral is sneaking out to have dates with a bartender in town. T’Mir is NOT happy and tries to stop him but like, what power does she have? Yes she’s his commanding officer, but y’know. But T’Mir eventually starts to come around. There’s a kid who’s a bright, friendly kid around town. She connects to him a bit.</p>

<p>Some Humans get trapped in a mine. Mestral steals a weapon to try and break them out. T’Mir is like “They only live at most 70 years so why even bother to extend their lives for a bit longer?” and he’s like “it’s called compassion? They’re my friends, and I’m going to help them.” T’Mir comes around and helps him though, guiding him through so he can do it safely without being caught.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/I7DNuc0.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They get a message. They’re being rescued in three days. T’Mir’s young friend wishes her luck moving back home. Turns out he can’t go to college after all, he wasn’t accepted. He needs money, but they’re just a poor bar family. T’Mir spends the next few days taking a train into the city…. where she shows a big corpo bro fucking VELCRO, then donates all the money. Fantastic.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/6gK2hEM.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Mestral doesn’t want to leave. He’s fascinated by this species. And Maggie. And her breasts. But mostly their species. So they pretend he died in the crash, and then they blast off. Trip is like “omg he was around for 30 presidents afterwards and no one caught it???” Do you imagine 80 years later, Mestral was watching the TV and saw Trump won re-election and was like “I should have gone back to Vulcan”</p>

<p>Trip and Archer don’t believe her, but then she goes back to her quarters and pulls out a purse left by her gram gram.</p>

<p>This was fantastic. Best episode of Enterprise so far, absolutely. It had the Star Trek optimism, actually good well-written Vulcans, funny good writing. It was just… fantastic.</p>

<p><strong>Minefield</strong> - ENT
5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/vug49cO.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Reed has a dinner with the Captain and is very awkward about it. The Captain is like “Dog, chill” then they’re called up to do some routine exploration when suddenly the fucking ship explodes.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/IYRaGLC.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Something just up and blew up a chunk of the ship. 17 Casualties, including Hoshi, but no fatalities. I’m STUNNED honestly. Turns out they’re in a mine field filled with a bunch of cloaked mines. One latches onto the ship, and Reed goes out into space to detatch it. Meanwhile, a green ship uncloaks, shoots a warning shot, and yells in some language they can’t understand, because Hoshi has a concussion.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/HgxLLpZ.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>While Reed is trying to defuse the bomb, a spike comes and impales Reed right in the leg. Foam stops his suit from bleeding oxygen, but things aren’t lookin’ good. Archer goes out to help him, give him some anesthetic, and has to shut it down with Reed’s advice now.</p>

<p>Hoshi translates just enough t o find out… it’s some group called the Romalin Star Empire? T’Pol corrects her. It’s pronounced Romulan. Holy shit, actual first contact with Romulans? This is what we WANTED from Enterprise, not any of that Temporal Cold War shit.</p>

<p>Reed and Archer have some hearts to heart. Reed admits he just feels it’s not right to fraternize with a superior officer. He’s kinda a boring dude, honestly, right down to it. He’s also just kinda unhappy with Archer cause he thinks Archer should be a shitty, bad captain. Reed has bad opinions.</p>

<p>The Romulans, now that Hoshi can translate the language, are like “Get the fuck out of here. Just detatched that hull plating, kill your crewman, and leave.” Ahh, Romulans. As unforgiving of any others existing as always. Anyways the mine will explode if they try and disarm it like this. So Reed tries to kill himself so that they’ll just knock off the plate off. He’s like “JUST BE A GOOD (read: bad) CAPTAIN FOR ONCE AND LET ME DIE A HERO”. Reed is a fucking weirdo.</p>

<p>Archer comes up with a big dumb plan. He cuts the thing, and it explodes. They use plating as shields and protect themselves, launching away from the blast. Absolutely nuts. But it works, the end.</p>

<p>They probably should have just cut through his leg. Anyways, I found this mostly boring. Reed is just kinda boring.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="Enterprise" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Retro Achievement Mastery 212 - Digital Devil Story - Megami Tensei II</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/10/17/RA212-Megaten2.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Retro Achievement Mastery 212 - Digital Devil Story - Megami Tensei II" /><published>2025-10-17T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-10-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/10/17/RA212-Megaten2</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/10/17/RA212-Megaten2.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/oLfzb2V.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>So a while ago, I made a post about Megami Tensei. I said I was trying to beat it but gave up cause it was kinda shitty and annoying, but I was playing Megami Tensei II and was enjoying it. That shows how behind on these I am, that was early August, it’s now the middle of October. I’ve actually mastered Megami Tensei 1 btw. Expect that post sometime soon. If you missed that post and are like “wait, but I don’t know what happened in Megaten 1” don’t worry. It really doesn’t matter much.</p>

<p>Megami Tensei 2 blows Megaten 1 out of the water so fucking hard it’s left orbit. Megaten 1 was frustrating, outdated, and annoying. Megaten 2 is one of the best retro RPGs I’ve ever played. The quality increase is frankly stunning.</p>

<p>Megaten 1 was a direct sequel to the books where you played as a nerd who invented a Devil Summoning program. That doesn’t matter now. This is a different story, kind of. It’s still a direct sequel. You’ll see. You get an intro telling you the world exploded in nuclear hellfire and almost everyone is fucking dead, and devils rule the world now. Well that bites. And then you name yourself and your female companion, much like Megaten 1, but also some other friend you have. Anyways here’s the game:</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/9XmMDBj.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>It plays MUCH differently from Megaten 1, huh? It’s a top down almost Dragon Quest style RPG. Huh, this map looks familiar. Wait, it IS the same map from Megaten 1! Weird. You wander around and are told you need to do a thing to release a spirit. Okay, cool. You and your ladyfriend wander around, gain levels, and can recruit demons. The demon recruiting in this is a LOT better than in Megaten 1. In 1 it was all random. Here you have some control over it. It’s still random, but you can learn to affect the random percentages and make it easier to befriend demons.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the tower, you defeat the minotaur boss much like MT1, and then release the spirit… who’s name is Pazuzu, and he tells you that this game was made by the creator of the demon summoning program, you two are the chosen ones, he’s working for God, and you must help him defeat Bael, an evil Demon who’s trying to take over Tokyo. What???</p>

<p>THAT’S RIGHT. The entire first hour or so of the game is a fucking <em>game inside a game</em>. You’re actually some random dork in an underground vault, alongside your other friend you named at the start. You’re playing a game Nakajima, the character from the first game, made of his adventures. And then you’re sent out of the game and into the “real world”.</p>

<p>I really cannot stress how cool this is, and how EXTREMELY it sets this game apart from the first. In the first, you’re given NO plot. You are dropped into one giant maze and that’s it. Here, they’re doing a fucking framing device. This is beyond impressive for 1990.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Oc13SE2.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Anyways from this point on, the game actually jumps back to the MT1 style movement of the first person dungeon crawling, and the Dragon Questy top down exploration when you’re on the overworld. You explore old vaults and broken buildings in first person. Along the way you’re accompanied NOT by the girl you named at the start, but instead your friend. But everyone’s talking about this Witch of Tokyo, and she has the same name of the girl from the game. Huh, weird. Pazuzu actually tells you she’s betrayed their cause and is siding with Bael to destroy humanity.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/8yObWIo.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Okay, this is where the game takes a bit of a hit for me. But even with this mistep, I think it’s impressive. I’ll explain. You go to take on this Witch, and have a conversation with her. Now, if you say the wrong things, you can <em>softlock your game</em>. You NEED to side with her to continue the game, otherwise you’re fucked. This is… bad. Very bad. And the dialogue, at least for the translation I used, is slightly stilted and hard to follow what they’re trying to say.</p>

<p>Despite that… I think what they’re TRYING here is actually very good?? It’s a good early RPG plot twist. She basically tells you “You’re being lied to by Pazuzu. I’m not working for Bael, and Pazuzu doesn’t have Humanity’s best interests in heart. Join me instead, and we can save Humanity”.</p>

<p>If you’ve played Shin Megami Tensei, this is going to be very familiar to you. Those games have an alignment system, which goes from Lawful to Neutral to Chaotic. This is basically setting up the start of that. You can’t be Chaotic in this game and side with Bael or anything, but it’s setting up a lawful (side with Pazuzu and God) or Neutral (side with Humanity and escape the cycle these two sides are forcing you into). It’s VERY good conceptually, but isn’t told perfectly. And honestly, that’s just a side effect of it being an NES game from 1990. Mother 1 has the exact same problem, an amazing idea and story that’s a bit stimied by its Bits.</p>

<p>Anyways after siding with the Witch, your friend is like “wtf, but we’re God’s Chosen??? We’re the main characters, you can’t do that! Well, next time we meet, we’ll be enemies” and goes off to become the Dark Hero you gotta fight throughout the game. And then you go around, collecting items and doing side quests to get further so you can defeat both Bael AND Pazuzu, then eventually the big G himself. And not only that, but you know who sides with you, the Big Good of this game who’s been rebelling against the evils of God this entire time? That’s right. Fucking LUCIFER.</p>

<p>When I first played this game I was like “I know the games later have you fight the Christian God, but there’s no way this game does that right?” Uh, no. That’s the plot twist. God is actually just as morally reprehensible as anyone else you’ve been fighting, and must be stopped. Fucking kill him. You get Lucifer on your team and <em>kill god</em>. It’s genuinely <em>nuts</em>. I imagine Atlus talking to a localizer like “can we bring this over to America” and that guy exploding in pure shock. This would have caused <strong>riots</strong> in America if it got on store shelves in 1990, because it’s not subtle, and it doesn’t mix its message. A God that allows these things to happen is doing it on purpose, and must be stopped, and any being that’s trying to rebel against Him for Humanity’s sake is a good guy.</p>

<p>It IS a little weird, considering Lucifer is the final boss and big bad of Megami Tensei 1, but I think by now you’ve realized this has very little to do with Megami Tensei 1 and is basically its own game. This is, in my opinion not Megami Tensei 2, but is really Shin Megami Tensei 0.</p>

<p>By the way, here’s the final boss music. It fucking WHIPS.</p>

<p>That’s one thing about this game I haven’t mentioned yet, it’s aesthetics are INCREDIBLE? One of the best looking and sounding NES games ever, frankly. Probably the best looking RPG??? Look, I love FF3 and DQ4 a lot. A looooooot. But this looks fucking fantastic. And the monster design is SO COOL.</p>

<p>Also the protagonist designs are RAD. In the middle of the game you’re collecting these items to open up a gateway to Hell so you can go beat the shit out of Bael, and one of them is in this giant mouth. You stick your hand in to grab it, and it fucking bites your hand off. You then have “one handed” as a status effect for a little bit, which drains your health and has you hit for nothing, but then THIS happens:</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/sc0gnRu.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>This is one of the sickest mother fucking character designs I’ve ever seen. Look at this dude with his keyboard computer robo-hand and big-ass cape. It’s SO FUCKING COOL. This is WHAT I WANT TO LOOK LIKE. GIVE ME AN 80s ROBO COMPUTER ARM. BITE MY FUCKING ARM OFF.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/FVWgsaz.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Your partner’s design is no slouch either, frankly. All the aesthetics are really on point. This is a grungy, shitty post apocalyptic world, and you gotta make a place to live in it.</p>

<p>I think I could go on, but I don’t need to. I’ve sung this game’s praises enough. From the amazing plot twists and set pieces to the primitive but impressive attempt at a story, this is one of the absolute best NES RPGs. I’d put it right up there with the likes of DQ 3 and 4, Final Fantasy 3, and Mother. It’s still got its rough retro edges, but it doesn’t get much better than this on this console. What an AMAZING glow up after Megaten 1.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="NES" /><category term="Retro Games" /><category term="RPG" /><category term="Megaten" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 191</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/10/17/OOCY191.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 191" /><published>2025-10-17T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-10-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/10/17/OOCY191</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/10/17/OOCY191.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/vkYvXpb.png" alt="'" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>On a whim, I decided to play this. This is a Game Gear homebrew Solitaire game based on Shenzhen I/O, a Zachtronics game. If you don’t know, Zachtronics is known for their Solitaire variants. And this is one of them, just ported to the Game Gear.</p>

<p>It’s a little confusing at first, considering it’s an entirely new variant of Solitaire with all new cards, but once you understand it, it’s honestly a pretty easy variant. You’ve got three kinds of cards. Number cards, which you need to get into the top right three slots. They stack like usual number cards in Solitaire do, and must be stacked in increasing value from 1. Normal stuff. Then you have the Dragon Cards. Claws, paws, and hoofs. These are put in the top left three slots. They  can’t be placed on any other card in the main playing area. And then the snep card, which is a flower in the original. It’s a “free” card that can be put in the top middle slot. Aaaand that’s it.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/rMeQceM.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>The game can’t have the entire play field on the screen at once, so you gotta scroll left and right. But that’s it. It’s solitaire. Simple and easy. Zachtronics makes good solitaire variants, check them out.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Game Gear" /><category term="Homebrew" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry></feed>
