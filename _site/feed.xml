<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p>IT’S BEEN A LOOOOONG ROOOOOAAAD</p>

<p>Welcome to season 3. Berman and Braga will be taking the backseat… but not yet, sadly.</p>

<p><strong>The Xindi</strong> - ENT
2.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/s8Vjp6y.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We get a scene to start with a council of a bunch of aliens, many very different designs. I like em! They’re like WE MUST FIND AND STOP THE HUMANS.</p>

<p>And then we get the theme song and what the fuck?? They completely changed the instrumentation. It was apparently made more upbeat and chipper. It’s a weird guitar, and the voicework sounds like they isolated it from the original recording so it’s weird as shit, almost like it’s missing some tones. But either way, why the FUCK would you want to make this more upbeat and chipper? It’s a fucking 9/11 allergory, what the shit are you doing</p>

<p>Okay, a few important notes. 1) Archer is weirdly grumpy and angry. Joy. And 2) There are some new characters!! MARINES. Yep, Archer asked for some marines to come on board. They’re fine enough for now, but god. This shit is 9/11 vibes, isn’t it?? Military, oh boy. That goes so well with Starfleet. They’re members of MACO, the Military Assault Command Operations.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/8XlGfpY.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They get a meeting with some miner foreman. He appears to snort liquid platinum, and wants it in exchange to talk to a Xindi that works in the mines. The Xindi comes up and is like “Yeah uh, we’re treated like slaves here. Get me out of here, and I’ll tell you my planet’s coordinates.” Trip attacks him. I am very much not looking forward to a season of angsty angry Trip and Archer. Anyways the Foreman betrays them and locks them down there, but the Xindi works with them to help them get out.</p>

<p>He explains that there are five distinct species of Xindi, which all look different. And none are dominant over the others, but there are arguments. Phlox mentioned that the DNA was weird. His DNA, this human-like one, is related to the lizard corpse they found, but not 100%. Weird. I don’t think thats how that works.</p>

<p>The escape plan fails, but they’re rescued by THE MARINE! RAH RAH! LOTS of people die in the process. We even get a girl marine fighting someone! Holy shit what? Anyways the Xindi is shot just outside the ship, which Neli called and got VERY angry that she was right about.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/6SImuPd.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They treat this guy like shit, go “WE’RE GONNA LEAVE YOU BEHIND” after he’s annoying and tries to throw them under the bus to save his own skin. Dude he’s your only lead. Anyways, he gives the coordinates before he dies. Okay.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/C2IHTqX.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Oh no. Ohhh no. Oh no oh no oh no. They’re gonna push this romance aren’t they? She uh, teaches him some Klingon Neuropressure… in order to try and help him sleep. But it’s clearly sexual and romantic and I am going to fucking scream. Why <strong><em>DOES EVERY WOMAN IN SPACE WANT TO FUCK THIS FUCKING GUY</em></strong></p>

<p>JUST PUT T’POL AND ARCHER TOGETHER FOR GOD’S SAKE. IF YOU’RE NOT GOING TO DO THE CORRECT THING AND PUT HER AND HOSHI TOGETHER.</p>

<p>The episode ends with the Insect Xindi being overly aggressive. Of course they’re the aggressive ones.</p>

<p>I don’t like this. A very, VERY bad omen.</p>

<p><strong>Anomaly</strong> - ENT
3.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/uGLEJmu.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Enterprise suddenly gets the shit beat out of it by some anomalies. Apparently there are some weird anomalies in the expanse that break the laws of physics. Are they ever gonna be explained? I highly doubt it. They limp along and find an alien ship that has no atmosphere and no biosigns. Archer, Reed, and some nameless marines go aboard. They find corpses. Two days ago. Whatever killed them is still nearby.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Eso9rv0.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Aliens come aboard and attack. It then becomes a  bunch of action sequences, of Enterprise characters trying to stop the pirates who are attacking. The pirates steal a bunch of cargo before teleporting out, though one of them is stunned and captured.</p>

<p>Archer is still a weirdly angy little pissant, acting kinda pissy towards T’Pol. He goes down to talk to the pirate they captured. He’s like “you can’t torture me for the info, you’re too soft. You have too much morals” and Archer goes “There’s too much at stake. I don’t have time for morals.” Don’t like that. Really do not like that. This ain’t gonna be no In The Pale Moonlight.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/z6rK2fC.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Enterprise chases the pirates, and finds a weird anomaly. Inside of it, they find some kind of giant manmade object. A giant sphere in space. They take a shuttle inside, finding a big door, and find some tubes moving large energy through, as well as some ports with breathable atmosphere inside. They find the pirate’s stash inside, with all the stolen shit and a bunch of other stuff which they take.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/JQlR7T4.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Archer continues to be EXTREMELY fucking angry. He realizes the prisoner might know anything about the Xindi, and fucking screams at him, drags him to the airlock, and almost kills him. The prisoner then gives him all the info he wants about his pirate friends and the Xindi. Torture! It works!</p>

<p>Do you all like those episodes where the captain you know and love gets really angry and become Ahab-y? How about a whole mother fucking season of that? Now, since the show has really constant continuity, this MIGHT turn out to be something good in the long run, as Archer realizes he can’t lose his humanity for this. But uh, I fucking hate this. I didn’t even like Archer that much to be honest? He’s already my least favorite captain, I think, but this is pretty bad, frankly.</p>

<p>The codes and info he gets works, and they defeat the pirate, so they let the captive go. The captive mocks them about it. Alright dude. The episode ends with data they downloaded from the pirates flashing across Archer’s face as he looks at a screen. How the fuck could you get ANY information from that?</p>

<p>This is not making me confident about the season.</p>

<p><strong>Extinction</strong> - ENT
1/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/fvJopqt.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We start the episode with an alien running through a jungle, persued by Firebats from Starcraft, who light him on fire, and he dies screaming. What the fuck?</p>

<p>Hey, I know what you wanted more of! Trip x T’Pol romance! Oh fucking boy!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/N6fj5Qx.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Trip gets a foot massage from T’Pol. I’m sure SOMEONE is turned on by this, but its not me.</p>

<p>Anyways they find some readings that maybe some Xindi are on a planet nearby, and they go down to check. They find a crashed ship and some corpses, but none of them are xindi that they’re aware of.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/4CB01py.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Everyone immediately starts mutating, becomes super aggressive, and yelling in some alien tongue. Everyone but T’Pol, who is mutating KIND OF but not fully. Vulcans sure are resiliant. You know how Vulcans are super strong and powerful, right? Yeah, well that’s why she immediately runs away when they attack her, trips over a fucking root and immediately knocks herself out. We’ve NEVER had strong T’Pol this entire time. Even when she was horny. What ever happened to They Have Great Strength When Aroused?</p>

<p>Rick Berman should be sent to the Hague. He wasn’t one of the people who wrote this episode, but he should be anyway, it would make me feel better.</p>

<p>All the mutated Humans swarm her, hissing and chittering like they’re season 1 Ferengi. That’s a very bad thing to be compared to. Except its <em>even worse</em>, because Mutated Archer is horny and wants to fuck T’Pol. Also the pacing is bad, it just keeps showing them being weird and creepy. People go down in suits, grab Reed, and take him back. He’s apparently infected by a Mutagenic virus. At the same time, an alien ship shows up thats like “You are now under quarantine, prepare to be boarded”. Trip stands his ground. The aliens say they’ve been combating this virus for 60 years and the only way to deal with it is to kill the infected so it doesn’t spread.</p>

<p>So we know how this is going to end. The white saviors are going to swoop in and solve it in two days, what these aliens couldn’t do in 60 years. BTW the alien is played by a black guy. I don’t think that was intentional subtext, but it IS fucking subtext.</p>

<p>There’s some weird shit with a dead city and genetic memory of it. The aliens come down to kill people, and T’Pol is once again thrown around like a sack of potatos, but Trip saves her. I want to scream. They warp back up, the aliens are like “WE’RE GOING TO KILL YOU” and then Archer walks out of the fucking door, fully fine. Holy SHIT they solved it off screen. What the fuck? That’s just… incompetent.</p>

<p>Archer decides to keep the last vial of the virus. He claims that the virus was a last ditch attempt by a species to keep the species alive. If he killed the virus, those people would be gone, and he refuses to cause the extinction of a people. Dude. That’s not how this works.</p>

<p>Remember that Voyager episode with the beacon that made people relive the last days of a civilization being war crimed to death? And they were like “we can’t destroy this, that’d be like erasing history”. This is like that, but instead they just shove the beacon in a drawer and forget about it forever.</p>

<p>This was just bad. Incompetently written. Even Braga thought it was bad, and Braga has VERY bad taste.</p>

<p><strong>Raijin</strong> - ENT
2.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/rVNhsCH.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>First we get a Xindi Council scene where a guy is like “I NEED MORE TIME TO CREATE THE DEATH STAR”, then it goes to more naked Trip and T’Pol time where Trip’s first words are “You can go harder” and I want to throw something through my window.</p>

<p>They go down to a planet looking to get some Trellium-D, which is a thing that can help negate the anomalies in this region of space. They get specifications on how to synthesize it in its liquid state, though its apparently highly unstable like that.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/XBQkHWw.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They meet and get info from a slave trader who trades in hot women, and then one of the hot women, a lady named Raijin, is like “omfg please take me with you” and they beat the slave trader up and free her. Okay, the right thing to do, for once.</p>

<p>Archer, no. No, Archer. No no no. Do not romance the slave girl you just freed. Do not fall for and romance the slave girl you just freed from slavery, Archer NO, NO ARCHER, YOU’LL BE CANCELLED ON TWITTER ARCHER, DO YOU WANT THAT ARCHER?!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/kNc20Sb.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>She starts wandering the ship and is IMMEDIATELY a sussy baka. She’s very flirty with everyone… and then she comes onto T’Pol. She apparently has some mind control sexy powers. Oh boy, time for more SEXUAL ASSAULT. She overwhelms T’Pol mentally, which is the ONLY THING Y’ALL ALLOW HER TO BE STRONG WITH, and then when she breaks free with Trip’s help (OF COURSE), she overwhelms her physically too. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH Y’ALL? She then goes on a fucking firefight through the ship, trying to escape as she calls for evac. Eventually she’s captured.</p>

<p>She says the words “She shouldn’t have resisted”. I need a drink.</p>

<p>ARCHER ANGY. GIRL WAS HOT AT ME, NOW SHE’S BAD, SO IT’S TIME TO BE ANGY &gt;:(</p>

<p>She explains that she was sent to collect genetics data to help the Reptilian Xindi build a bioweapon to wipe out Humanity.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ZfV6c3M.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Some Xindi board the ship and rescue Rajin. Two Reptiles and an Insectoid. They succeed, but not before the Humans scan their ship, their warp capabilities, AND capture one, who dies via suicide pill, basically.</p>

<p>Back to the Xindi council, everyone is PISSED the Lizards and Insects went above board and risked teaching the Humans more about them. Rajin tries to defend the Humans, but is thrown out before she can. The end.</p>

<p><strong>Impulse</strong> - ENT
2.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/v5SfvLU.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We get a cold open with them trying to shove T’Pol in a scanner thing, strapping her in as she screams bloody murder, screaming she’ll kill them, screaming her HEART OUT, fade to black.</p>

<p>…
…</p>

<p><em>soft strings play</em> It’s been a loooong roaaad~</p>

<p>Jump cut back, they all get into a shuttle and fly through an asteroid belt towards the Soleil, a Vulcan ship that had been lost in the expanse and is sending out an automated distress call. THey hope they fared better than the other Vulcan ship we learned about, where everyone died violently like it was a horror movie.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/jyE0F1X.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The horror movie continues. The Vulcans are basically zombies. This turns into Alien, but with zombie Vulcans, and LOT of flashing lights for some reasons. It also seems to be affecting T’Pol. She’s getting more and more emotional. Why do we keep doing this to T’Pol??</p>

<p>Also there’s a B-plot of Trip and mining asteroids. Okay.</p>

<p>Hey, wounded redshirt, stay behind with the Vulcan who might be losing her mind. Holy <strong>SHIT EVERYONE HERE IS SO INCOMPETENT</strong></p>

<p>There is a LOT of flashing in this episode. It’s legit really hard to even look at.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/QzmenR1.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Remember the season 1 episode where everyone was getting suspicious and racist, except for T’Pol, who was immune? This is just the opposite of that. And I didn’t like that episode very much either. T’Pol pulls a gun on them but is overpowerd, because she woman.</p>

<p>Phlox finds out that Trellium D is toxic to Vulcans, and breaks their brains. T’Pol can be saved but the other Vulcans are past saving, so they blow up the ship and escape. Oh good, it’s still flashing during the explosion.</p>

<p>The pacing in this episode fucking blows, I’mma be real with you. This escape takes like 5 fucking minutes and nothing happens but then running, things flashing, and shit exploding.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/EAvHo56.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Remember that recent episode where Archer was five seconds away from killing that guy with the airlock? And he only stopped cause the guy gave him the info he wanted? I think we’ll be returning to this image a lot this season.</p>

<p>Anyways, T’Pol is rescued, and all is well… but now she’s having nightmares about the ship. Understandable tbh. And she wakes up, Phlox coddles her, the end.</p>

<p><strong>Impulse</strong> - ENT
3.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/zcnvRPf.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Oh BOY, it’s a Hoshi episode! Holy SHIT, they actualyl are writing things for Hoshi? But lower your expectations. It seems to be an episode where a psychic alien fucks with a woman aboard the crew, cause let’s retread THAT TNG plotpoint, not any of the fucking good ones. Anyways she sees an alien who’s like “Hoshi, can you hear me?” and then disappears. Okay.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, T’Pol thinks she has a breakthrough. The weird things here in the expanse APPEAR to be coming from the Spheres. That means they can predict where they are. They make their way to another sphere that seems to be nearby.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/tz3magI.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Hoshi starts seeing things again. She dreams she’s teleported to that castle from Batman Begins. When she comes to, she tells everyone, AGAIN, of what she saw, and AGAIN, they go “don’t be silly Hoshi. What a dumb woman she is” and walk away. Hey, remember how in EVERY OTHER STAR TREK PROPERTY TO EVER EXIST, when weird shit happens to a single person, they go “Okay, let’s figure this out” and don’t immediately ignore that person and tell them they’re crazy?? Yeah, I FUCKING MISS THAT. AND IT ONLY EVER HAPPENS TO WOMEN IN THIS SHOW. They only finally come around on it when Hoshi gives them imperical data and evidence. Fucking christ. They make their way to this alien’s Batman Begins castle.</p>

<p>They meet this telepath, he’s a weird ugly alien. His name is Tarquin. He’s been here on this planet alone for a very long time and is very lonely. He also has a super power. He can touch things made by people and learn things about them, like where they’re from or who they were. …Wait a fucking minute.</p>

<p>THAT’S THE POWER OF THE MAIN CHARACTER OF MY NOVELS. What the fuck?! I swear, I did not steal that idea from fucking Enterprise. Anyways, Tarquin offers to help them find info on the Xindi if he can hang out with Hoshi cause he’s lonely. He makes her pizza. The thing is, this guy actually has some pathos. I feel for him. He’s a good character. If he ends up JUST being a sad lonely dude who wants a friend, but doesn’t know how to communicate with people other than through his telepathy, that’d be really good tbh. But uh, it’s Enterprise. So it’s not going to be like that. Instead he’ll be a creepy sex pervert who’s trying to isolate Hoshi from the others so she can be his hot mistress.</p>

<p>It doesn’t help that Hoshi can only ever really give off the energy that she really does not want to be here.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/wCDKZFs.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Tarquin teaches Hoshi some psychic stuff. Woah, Hoshi Psychic Arc??? No, absolutely not. This will probably never come up again. Hoshi also finds some graves, and is extremely freaked out. He’s like “oh they’re just my exes, I live a lot longer than people so they passed away. Hey, wanna be mine? No one can understand you like I can.” Aaaaand there it is. Ahhh man.</p>

<p>Trip and Archer land on another sphere, and Trip’s incompetence almost strands then. Why the FUCK is this guy in Starfleet</p>

<p>Tarquin apologizes for trying to force Hoshi to marry him, and wishes her well. And theeen tries tricking her into staying with him by impersonating Archer telepathically. Then when she realizes it, he tries to hold Enterprise hostage. This is awful, and I do not like it. She ends up winning in a way I DO like though. By putting her fucking foot down, and being kinda badass. Like “I WILL DESTROY YOUR ONLY WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE, AND THEN DIE HERE AND YOU’LL BE ALL ALONE.” Good on her. It doesn’t save the episode though!</p>

<p>He sends Hoshi one last psychic message, giving her more info about the Xindi, and some coordinates. Of course he does it in a creepy incel way, saying “I don’t want you harmed. You might change your mind about me some day~” Gross, dude.</p>

<p><strong>Impulse</strong> - ENT
6.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/AlMSzWw.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Enterprise heads for the coordinates Tarquin sent them to, which appears to be where they’re building some of the doomsday weapon. They find some Xindi, these weird furry ones. They’re mining Kemocite and shipping it off somewhere… Archer and his team attack a scientist in his home, and Archer is fucking PISSSSSED. The Xindi, Garlik, for what its worth, seems to not even know what this thing is being used for. He doesn’t know anything about a weapon.</p>

<p>Reed: “Congralations, sir. We’ve only been here 3 months, and we’re already about to destroy one of their weapons facilities.”</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/EAvHo56.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Why is Reed so unlikable. Also, wow, where did this image come from?</p>

<p>Also there’s a subplot about Trip and Phlox and T’Pol trying to learn more about the Xindi weaponry.</p>

<p>Archer continued to harass this fucking guy, who keeps denying he did any warcrimes. Eventually he pushes the bomb piece in his face enough for him to realize that yes, it was because of him and his Kemocite that his people mined. He was TOLD it was just for research. Whoops. Sometimes Archer is understanding here, sometimes he gets pissy and angry. But eventually he seems to calm down about this. Gralik explains the Xindi history. There were six Xindi species, though one is extinct now, the Avians. The Reptilians and the Insects are violent, and aggressive, and are the ones who blew up the planet during a civil war.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/K0sKmr8.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Gralik is a calm guy, but he’s like, QUIET angry about this whole thing. At first it was at Archer pointing a gun in his face, but now that he knows he indirectly killed seven million innocents, he wants to do what he can to stop this from ever happening again. When Reptilians show up 3 days early for the final shipment, they go with Gralik’s plan. He doesn’t really mention what it is, but they’re basically just hiding him now. All the while the Reptilian leader is a Star Trek villain so he’s aggressive and unrelenting in a “HOW DARE YOU NOT BE READY WHEN I SHOWED UP 3 DAYS EARLY” kind of way, just to add the ticking clock.</p>

<p>Actual good moment for Archer. Gralik asks if he intends to blow up their livelihood and kill them, and he’s like “The attack on our planet was not your fault. And I won’t make you pay for it.” Imagine that. Reed is like “IT’S A BAD IDEA TO TRUST HIM, WE SHOULD KILL THEM ALL” cause Reed is actually kind of awful. Wow, I like Archer when he’s thoughtful and not angy, but he’s angy like 90% of the time now.</p>

<p>omfg, Gralik was chill this entire time. He was amicable. But in the end, the thing that makes him angry. The Reptilian rushing him. He’s like “FUCK YOU, I TAKE PRIDE IN MY WORK”. Go, buddy, go.</p>

<p>They end up poisoning the shipment. The Xindi taking the kemocite are like “you’re doing this to help stop a RUTHLESS ALIEN SPECIES, DON’T WORRY”. He’s a LITTLE worried, but is like “Fuck it, I trust these Humans” and helps them anyway. He wishes them luck with finding the weapon. This will delay it, but not forever.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/t3XQlth.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Maybe this will end the Angy Archer Arc? Please god.</p>

<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p>IT’S BEEN A LOOOOONG ROOOOOAAAD</p>

<p><strong>First Flight</strong> - ENT
7/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/s8Vjp6y.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Archer is lookin’ at some cool Dark Matter, and then gets a call from Admiral Forrest about some guy named A.G. who died climbing Mount McKinley. Archer is super bummed about it and wants to go on the Dark Matter mission by himself, some alone time, but T’Pol forces her way on. She’s just worried about him, it’s sweet. Archer tells her about him.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/0Won53j.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We get a flashback to something called the NX-Project, a warp engine. It seems like a long while ago (seven years apparently), but uh, Archer is old as hell still, even though he’s trying to act the part of a younger man. A.G. isn’t much better. Archer is called in and told that A.G, another captain, is being given the assignment to pilot Enterprise instead. A.G. is pretty boastful about it. Turns out they weren’t really ‘friends’ per se, more rivals.</p>

<p>The test flight goes… poorly. A.G. claims he got the job because he doesn’t play by the book, and he decides to push the engine way past where it should be while everyone is like “Uh dog, your ship is gonna collapse if you do this”. It fucking does. It explodes alongside Jupiter. Everyone assumes he dies, which like… this would be more suspensful if we didn’t know he already survived this.</p>

<p>Oh of COURSE Trip is here. He claims he’s working under Captain Jeffries. Eh, a little nod. They get A.G. back, and he tells off the Vulcans, of course. Oh my GOD they explain Trip’s nickname. He’s the third Charles Tucker, so he’s the triple one. Trip. They fucking Han Solo’d Trip, but like, in series. I dunno if that really counts actually.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/tC0y5nz.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>A.G. and Archer get in a scuffle cause A.G. claims it was his father’s shitty engine that caused the problems, and not him refusing to listen to others. He’s kinda clearly in the wrong here, ESPECIALLY cause we know the engine is fine <strong>because we’re watching a show right now where the engine is letting them move at warp 5</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/5ed07F2.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Archer concedes to A.G. about this for some reason, I don’t get it. Especially cause he proves through some telemetry that they can easily fix this problem, but the Vulcans want the Humans grounded. They just needed to prove it. So A.G. convinces Archer to steal the second test ship and fly it himself. He also promises Trip that he’ll put him on his ship if he gets a big one. Thanks for that, Archer. The flight works, proving the ship can fly. The Vulcans can’t dispute that. Though this stunt pisses everyone off, and they’re grounded for months. Got off SHOCKINGLY light. I think the higher ups agreed, prolly.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/S5HpbFX.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Anyways Archer finishes his story and we get a conclusion to the Dark Matter story, where they make the dark matter explode and light up all pretty. They name it after A.G. and move on.</p>

<p>The framing story is kinda poorly paced, but it was cute, I liked it. Also its nice to have actual world building for Enterprise.</p>

<p><strong>Bounty</strong> - ENT
2.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/1HIoxjj.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Holy SHIT a Tellerite. This is the first time we’re seeing them in a very, VERY long time. One episode of TOS.</p>

<p>A Tellerite finds Enterprise above a planet, and is super friendly. Offers to come over and show them some things he’s found about the planet. He IMMEDIATELY shoots Trip and Archer and abducts the captain.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/dGpcohL.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>You know what this episode where our captain is kidnapped needed? A long, sensual scene where we get T’Pol and Phlox in decon rubbing gel on each other. Holy SHIT, Berman. This is by far the most egregious decon scene we’ve seen. I knew there’d be lots of these, but was expecting more tbh. There haven’t been many lately. I know they’re supposed to stop soon but we get one last one… and worst of all? T’Pol is acting…. weird.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Archer tries talking to the Tellerite about this. Apparently he’s been abducted by a bounty hunter working for the Klingons. Archer DID escape from prison, after all. The Tellerite isn’t a HUGE asshole. He’s like “Look, I’m sure you’re not a bad person, just an unlucky one. But I need the money. Sorry.”</p>

<p>T’Pol is getting VERY emotional. God please don’t be what I think it is.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/0z36wbb.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Fucking christ on the cross, it is.</p>

<p>Hey, remember when Spock and Tuvok underwent pon’far on screen and started acting like sexy little kittens, trying to seduce and mewl?</p>

<p>I’d watch that episode actually. Hmm.</p>

<p>Credit where its due, T’Pol’s actor is putting everything she has into it. She’s not like Troi’s actress, where if she gets something sexist and dumb she just kinda shuts down. She’s playing the horny Sex Kitten very effectively, but it fucking sucks. At least it’s with Phlox and not Trip. Can you fucking imagine? I’d have given this a 1 and left the room. Phlox is VERY professional about all of this.</p>

<p>The painful thing is the Tellerite storyline is actually quite good. This Tellerite captain’s got pathos. He made a small mistake, which is only a crime to the Klingons, and his ship was impounded by the Klingons and he was lucky to escape with his life. Gee, does that sound like anyone? It’s a good story. And even when it’s clear that things aren’t going to go well, and he’s never gonna get his ship that was stolen from him back from the Klingons, if he helps Archer he’ll just be killed. And of course they only give him 2/3rds of what he was told he’d get. Of course. I know Klingons are often dickheads but wow. Before Archer is taken though, the Tellerite gives him a lockpick so he can try to escape, and then tells the Enteprise where to find Archer.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/2T3HSZd.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The conclusion to the T’Pol storyline is she breaks out and runs around trying to fuck anyone she can while sweating and screaming. She’s shot and knocked out. Rick Berman should be in jail.</p>

<p>Oh, Archer shot some people with a stolen Klingon gun. Those don’t have a stun setting. Add that to his list of Klingon Crimes. Anyways he escapes. The Tellerite tells him to be safe, and it ends.</p>

<p>The A plot had a great setup but not a very good payoff, and the B plot was absolutely fucking awful.</p>

<p><strong>The Expanse</strong> - ENT
4/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/kfX6jvN.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Apparently this episode will completely toneshift the show and setup the third season, is is supposedly VERY different. I’m ready. God, I’m ready for ANYTHING different.</p>

<p>Our episode starts with an unknown probe blowing up Florida. I was cheering. Then the probe hit Cuba, and I was like “NO NO, SHIT”. Meanwhile, the Klingons go “WE NEED TO STOP THAT DASTARDLY ARCHER” and send Duras after him. When Archer learns of the attack, he’s recalled back to Earth. Trip is DEVESTATED. He IS from Florida, after all. His sister might have been among the 3 million casualties. And then suddenly, the Suliban attack and Archer is suddenly kidnapped. Wow this episode is paced REALLY fast.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/u7B4XY2.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The Shadowy Figure is here! Remember him? He’s the Palpatine-ass mother fucker who’s a player in the Temporal Cold War, and has the Suliban working for him. He’s surely going to be important, right? Nope! This is his last appearance! :D But even though we never learn who he is, we know who he was SUPPOSED to be. Guess! It’s fucking Archer, from the future, apparently. That’s dumb, but it’s dropped so who cares.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/T61jd9o.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Anyways Palpatine tells Archer that the attack was by the Xindi. They are aliens who learned that their planet will be destroyed by Earth in 400 years, so they’re trying to kill the Humans now to stop it. Archer returns home and is attacked by Duras, but he’s pushed off. Man this episode REALLY has a bad pacing problem. They’re trying to cram so much in so quickly. When he returns home, they learn where the Xindi are. The Xindi are apparently in an area called The Delphic Expanse, a giant region in the beta quadrant that is dangerous and barely explored.</p>

<p>The Vulcans are as awful as usual, sending some weirdo to try and declare Archer mentally unwell cause he’s talking about time travel. He lies about who he is and why he’s there to do this. Phlox is PISSED. “Where is your sense of medical ethics?!” “I’m just doing what I’m told.” YEAH DUDE THAT’S ALWAYS A GOOD EXCUSE.</p>

<p>Trip finds out his sister was killed in the attack, and becomes super pissy about it. I get it, but 2 seasons of Trip being the worst character, now him becoming a super angsty angry mother fucker… I don’t appreciate it.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/6cCTSIl.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Everyone gets to decide if they can stay on Enterprise… except for one person. T’Pol doesn’t get a choice. She WANTS to stay on board, and is kind of pissed. No one is happy to see her go. Except maybe Trip. Also everyone gets a scene about if they should stay, except for Mayweather and Hoshi. Hoshi HAD one but it was removed from the episode. Of course. Who cares about her, right??</p>

<p>Oh good. Trip is like “It’s a good thing she’s leaving, she’s push for noninterference, and we need to kill all of the Xindi” OKAY DUDE. YEAH, WE SHOULD KEEP HIM ON BOARD, THAT’S A GREAT FUCKING IDEA. He’s VERY Starfleet!</p>

<p>Enterprise is retrofitted and heads out, and is immediately attacked by Duras again. But Enterprise took a level up and easily kicks their asses.</p>

<p>T’Pol announces she’s resigning her commission and quitting the High Command to stay on Enterprise. Ey, first Vulcan in Starfleet? :o The Vulcans are NOT gonna like that.</p>

<p>You know what we need? A THIRD FIGHT WITH THE KLINGONS. Duras gets other Klingons to chase Archer with him, but they flee from the Expanse cause it’s scawy. Duras chases after him, cause I mean clearly nothing’s deterring him from this… I dunno why he’s even still here, the Klingons at teh start said “YOU HAVE ONE MORE CHANCE DURAS” and then gave him three fucking chances in this episode. Well, Archer FINALLY decides to kill Duras, blowing up his ship. Bout time.</p>

<p>And then they move into the Expanse, the end.</p>

<p>This episode’s pacing was bad. Hopefully this is not an omen of things to come.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="Enterprise" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Retro Achievement Mastery 213 - Portal Advance</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/11/18/RA213-Portal.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Retro Achievement Mastery 213 - Portal Advance" /><published>2025-11-18T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2025-11-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/11/18/RA213-Portal</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/11/18/RA213-Portal.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/yK8rH3U.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Man, remember when Portal was the only thing that mattered? This is actually from a bit beyond that. This is a homebrew from 2016 by Ashley Samuelson, and is probably just a personal project thing. Yep, it’s yet another Homebrew game. I sometimes like to check these out because they’re often really short and easy, and sometimes you find some interesting stuff with them!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/5TPTLvS.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>I don’t really have much to comment on here, though. You play as a Companion Cube that can slide around and jump. You eventually obtain your own portal gun, but there are only like 10-15 screens. It’s really more of a beta than anything else. There’s no music or sound effects, probably because the GBA’s sound setup is hell on earth. None of the screens are super complex, because it’s 2D, so you don’t get any of the wild puzzle setups you could get in the original Portal, or especially Portal 2.</p>

<p>It’s a cute little thing for like 10 minutes, though.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Gameboy Advance" /><category term="Homebrew" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 198</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/11/18/OOCY198.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 198" /><published>2025-11-18T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2025-11-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/11/18/OOCY198</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/11/18/OOCY198.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/KBALRgX.png" alt="'" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p>IT’S BEEN A LOOOOONG ROOOOOAAAD</p>

<p><strong>Judgement</strong> - ENT
8/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/JntZ4rP.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Our episode starts with Archer dragged in chains in front of a Klingon tribunal, claiming he’s accused of crimes of sabotage against the empire. He pleads not guilty.</p>

<p>Some of the best Trek episodes are Klingon Law episodes. <strong>Please be good.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/KvcifXo.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Archer is being defended by Not-Martok here. Archer is being accused by someone named Duras… that name is important. Duras says he was going after Klingon traitors, who were on the Enteprise. When he demanded they be handed over, Archer said “No, I’ve made an alliance with these people, back away now or join your ancestors in the afterlife”. I’m starting to think Archer didn’t actually say these things! Archer also fires first. When Archer objects, he’s yelled at, as that is against the rules of the tribunal. Ahh, kangaroo courts. Not-Martok (his name is Kolos) defends ARcher very poorly, and Archer gets tazed for trying to defend himself.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/xIEDm2t.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Kolos is an old attorney, and has been doing this for a while, and he’s pretty pissed at what they’re doing. But he’s doing his best to get Archer found guilty so he can make his sentence less violent. Archer calls him out on it. He’s afraid of it, but he ends up stepping up to the plate after all.</p>

<p>Archer tells his side of the story, after Kolos argues for it. He found some Klingon civilians who were fleeing the empire after their colony was abandoned by the empire. They are willing to help them, and then Duras shows up. They are ready to defend their ship, but not violent of course. All the while the prosecutor is mocking and claiming he’s a violent savage who has declared war on the empire, all nonsense. Of course, when Duras shows up, Archer is like “Hey, let’s sit down and try to=” and is immediately fired upon.</p>

<p>Something I’ve noticed from Enterprise is that it keeps reusing old ideas. A Klingon tribunal episode with some Klingons who are corrupt and self serving, desiring violence and aggression, and the few noble Klingons willing to work things out helping out.</p>

<p>Kolos eventually is like “If Archer is guilty, he’s guilty of being a nuisance”, and uses the fact that Archer has help Klingons a lot recently to show that he’s clearly not an enemy of the Empire, and has no interest in starting a rebellion or war with it. While they’re waiting for the outcome, Kolos is like “you don’t expect Klingons to all be warriors?” “Yeah, kinda”. This is it! This is the episode that’s like “What the fuck, no, of course Klingons have things that aren’t warriors”. His dad was a teacher. Hell yeah. Teachers have honor.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/BPTHZfO.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Archer is guilty, but because of his help for the Empire in the past, he won’t be killed. He’s just going to be sent to Rura Penthe for the rest of his life. Hey, that’s the place from Star Trek 6! Nice. Kolos is PISSED, and declares that that IS death, life expectancy there is like six months. He declares the court has no honor and is thrown to Rura Penthe for a year, too. Whoops.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/W08ovIr.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Reed comes to break them out. Kolos refuses to go with him. He’s spent 50 years being an advocate, and 20 years of that holding his tongue and sending honorable men to places like this. He’s going to survive that year and change things. Shine on, you beautiful Klingon.</p>

<p>That was just a good episode. Thank god.</p>

<p><strong>Horizon</strong> - ENT
8/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/QWmvxKt.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Holy <em>shit</em>, a Mayweather episode???</p>

<p>In my Discord, we have a meme sticker based on a random Memory Alpha image.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Li66WeQ.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>I dunno why but it tickles me. I hope this episode is just this for 28 minutes. Enterprise passed by the Horizon, Mayweather’s family’s ship, then coming back soon after. So Mayweather asks to visit his dad, since he’s sick. Unfortunately, before he can get to the ship, he discovers the news. His dad actually passed away six weeks ago, but he never got the news. Mayweather is DEVESTATED, especially cause they didn’t leave on good terms. His dad was unhappy he left the barge. Genuinely fantastic scene with Archer, where he tells Mayweather about a letter his dad sent telling him to hire his son. “I’ve never met a better stick and rudder man and you’d be a fool not to choose him”. Genuinely great scene.</p>

<p>The B-plot in this episode seems to be “T’Pol is convinced to watch horror movies with the crew”. Usually I’d hate B-plot nonsense like that but I kinda love this idea and I hope she likes them. They’re watching Frankenstein.</p>

<p>I really hope this episode continues to just be Mayweather spending time with his family in a slow, chill, slice of life way. He meets his mom and brother, now acting captain. It’s still his old home, but he kind of has a new home now, it’s a good kind of story to tell. But I’m afraid there’s gonna be a thing like they try to kidnap him or they need his help through some major problem.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/qEnWetr.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>YES, TRIP, THAT’S WHAT MARY SHELLEY IS KNOWN FOR. THAT’S WHAT’S MOST IMPORTANT ABOUT HER. THAT SHE’S THE WIFE OF A FAMOUS POET. YOU FUCKING HACK.</p>

<p>No one but me can name a fucking Percy Shelley poem, and I have a fucking degree. But everyone knows Frankenstein. Go fuck yourself, dog.</p>

<p>Things aren’t all peachy on the Horizon. Mayweather’s brother is a nice enough guy but he’s tense, and not really ready for this. He also gets testy at Mayweather for overstepping his new captain duties (Mayweather was SUPPOSED to take the captain job, so there’s some bad blood there). An old crush of Mayweather’s tells him things are tense and he’s not a great captain. And then they’re attacked.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/2FwGlkk.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The pirates have a VERY weird strategy. Plant a beacon on a ship, then send a really big scary ship to demand the cargo later. Mayweather goes above his brother again and they get into a fight. There’s still lots of grumpiness there, but his mom is like “ah give him time, you’re doing good shit”</p>

<p>Holy shit. “What did you think of the movie?” “I found the main character interesting.” “Doctor Frankenstein, huh?” “No, the creation” “…that’s one way of looking at it”. YES, TRIP. I SUPPOSE THAT IS ONE WAY OF LOOKING AT IT, SURE. AND BY ONE WAY I MEAN THE FUCKING ONLY WAY, YOU GOD DAMN HACK. THAT’S THE FUCKING POINT OF THE MOVIE. Anyways she’s like “the villager’s reactions remind me of Vulcan first contact, I’ll suggest Soval show this to every Vulcans arriving on Earth.” Very funny.</p>

<p>The pirates come around and the Captain’s plans to deal with them by giving them everything don’t work, so they have to rely on Mayweather’s strategy. It works, smooths things over with the brothers, and they part on good terms.</p>

<p>Again, another good episode. Holy shit, two in a row.</p>

<p><strong>The Breach</strong> - ENT
6.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/13wMY35.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Holy shit, Phlox has a tribble. Imagine that. Well, he has one to feed to one of his pets. Which he does violently. It freaks Hoshi out.</p>

<p>Anyways, he gets a message and asks Archer for help. Three Denobulans are on a planet that recently fell under a new government, an extremely xenophobic one. Trip, Reed, and Mayweather have three days to go down, find them, extract them, and get the hell out before they are considered illegal and arrested. Meanwhile, they rescue a ship that is exploding above the planet, and Phlox has to treat the crew, one of which he seems apprehensive about. Uh oh!</p>

<p>Reed and Trip are so fucking incompetent, why do they outrank Mayweather?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/B9stI31.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We found out the problem. The patient is Antaran, and apparently they and the Denobulans were at war a few times, and they were very bitter disputes. The last war was 300 years ago, but there is VERY bad blood. The Antaran refuses to be treated by him, and would rather die. Archer orders Phlox to perform the surgery anyway, but Phlox refuses, because uh, that’s how medical ethics works. Archer tries to force him, but Phlox refuses. Also he outranks the captain on medical issues anyway, Archer?? There are two kinds of Archer. Good, honorable Archer…. and Angy Archer. We’ve got Angy Archer today. Boo.</p>

<p>Apparently the Denobulans did some REALLY sketchy strategies in their war and killed a shiiiiit ton of Antarans. 20 million of them. Phlox admits it is not a proud history, but one they try to move past. But also, it seems like his side isn’t willing to try and reconcile either.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/grjeSiH.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>You know what this episode about racism needed? Cave slapstick. It doesn’t help that we can barely see anything cause of the lighting. And of course Mayweather is the one to get hurt, but also save everyone’s lives.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/FCF7Ud8.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The Antaran treats Phlox like shit, and he gets fed up and leaves. The Antaran is now like “Ha ha I win, I proved that he’s not the perfect goody twoshoes he claims to be”. And he’s going to die. Congrats on your victory, dude.</p>

<p>Phlox talks to T’Pol about this. When he was a kid, he wanted to go to a beautiful planet. His grandma told him not to go, because the Antarans had once lived there, even though it was a very long time ago, and now the planet was tained. He didn’t go. But when he had kids of his own, he took them there. Because he didn’t want them raised like he was raised. Phlox is, in fact, actually a good person. But he has internal biases from being raised as such. But he refuses to let them continue.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/WqUvpXX.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Trip and Reed make their way to the Denobulans deep in the cave, who are like “Thanks but we’re good, we don’t want to leave”. Good thing they sent the two diplomats here! Trip orders them up at gunpoint. Oh good. Glad that’s the end to this storyline. A shaggy dog story that makes Trip look like even more of an asshole.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/jvSQhIr.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Phlox explains to the Antaran about his family. He has five kids. He tried to teach them to be better than his grandmother was. All are, except one, who was persuaded to far right xenophobic politics. Phlox stopped talking to him because of this. His racist son would want nothing more than for Phlox to just let him die. But he doesn’t want to. Eventually he agrees to the procedure, and has his life saved.</p>

<p>We did it! We solved racism!</p>

<p>Everyone goes their seperate ways, and the episode ends with Phlox writing to his son, hoping it changes something in him.</p>

<p>The episode was pretty good for the most part… but the cave plot was unneccesary and bad.</p>

<p><strong>Crogenitor</strong> - ENT
2/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/3n85v7P.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Before this episode started, we took a break to make popcorn. I read this episode’s description and found out it’s about gender.</p>

<p>I got some whisky. I might need it.</p>

<p>Enterprise is studying a hypergiant star. While there, they discover a ship floating along nearby. They talk, and are very friendly! They offer to help trade info, and are excited to become friends, they’re a very nice species and are almost like Humans in their xenophilic stance… except one thing. While chatting up the captain, Trip says  hello to one, who seems shocked by the hello. They explain its a “Crogenitor”, they’re trying to have a baby.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/kv4xvEX.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Trip is confused, and talks to Phlox. They’re a three gendered species, the crogenitor is used for mating. They use it/its pronouns apparently. Phlox has pictures, and is excited to share them! Trip is not interested… until he talks to the captain, who wants to share info about his engine, but all Trip wants to know about is their Crogenitor. They are a bit weirded out by him asking about it.</p>

<p>Trip is REALLY hung up on this. Specifically, he’s hung up on the fact that they appear to treat this Crogenitor like dirt. It has no rights. He comes to T’Pol about it who’s like “the captain wants a working relationship with them, it’s not our problem” and Phlox goes “It’s not our problem, it’s their society and reproductive system”. I’m honestly stunned this is their reaction to a blatant problem. There’s clearly a slavery type situation happening here and they’re ignoring it cause hey we might make friends. Why would you WANT to be their friend? Trip has the right idea IMO, but he handles it in the WORST, CLUNKIEST WAY. He has NO tact, NO grace, and no understanding that he’s wading into a mother fucking minefield. It’s straight up punishment to watch.</p>

<p>He sneaks around the ship and tries to teach it how to read. It’s confounded by this. Like, this episode isn’t offensive, cause it has the right idea, it’s just poorly written, and frankly unable to meet the moment. It should be NO surprise Brennan and Braga wrote this. They are a plague upon Star Trek.</p>

<p>Trip is THE WORST FUCKING CHARACTER TO HAVE DONE THIS.</p>

<p>This episode also is REALLY overloaded. There’s a C-plot. A: This third gender thing. B: Archer and his new boyfriend explore the sun. C: Reed gets a new girlfriend. He’s totally straight, guys.</p>

<p>Pauline in my chat described this episode pretty well. This is not an episode about a mistreated slave class. This is a white savior episode. It’s not really about the slave itself. It’s about Trip being the white savior. It’s like the opposite side of the Harry Potter SPEW shit, and I’m sorry for bringing that up, but its like the opposite of that and it’s just as well written. Trip has ALL the agency here, and that feels bad.</p>

<p>Excuse me I need to be a pedantic Trek nerd for a second. Yes it’s fun to have Dixon Hill here, but Bride of Chaotica? THAT SHIT WAS WRITTEN BY TOM PARIS LIKE 200 YEARS AFTER THIS. 0/10.</p>

<p>Or maybe this has EXTREME implications for lore???</p>

<p>Trip names it (calls it her, so I will call her her, but he only calls her her cause she has an actress so whatever) Charles. Charles learns VERY fast and realizes it has a shitty life and asks for asylum. Archer thinks about it, which stresses his new friends and stresses relations, but eventually denies asylum. For some reason. I guesss so the episode can happen. They leave on tense, but still friendly terms… until Archer learns that Charles committed suicide.</p>

<p>YES, TRIP, IT IS.</p>

<p>Archer tore him apart about this, telling him that his impulsive actions killed someone. Trip, at least, is kinda traumatized by this. I hope this means Trip will cool off with his impulsive bullshit but I am not confident.</p>

<p>Bad. I can see ways this could be good. As Neli says, “an episode where Trip’s bumbling incompetence and impulsive bullshit causes him to fuck up first contact, and pushing to form a prime directive, can be good, but ALL the framing is very bad”. And I agree 100%.</p>

<p>Oh Christ. I was so worried this is something we were going to do.</p>

<p>In the arctic, some researches find a crashed alien ship. They find aliens under the ice. Humanoids with cybernetics where their eye should be. YEP. A BORG EPISODE. 200 years before Borg First Contact. And we can thank the movie First Contact for this. It’s creating suffering long after its creation. Fucking garbage-ass movie. Anyways, what follows is basically The Thing. They’re studying the Borg, wondering wtf their deal is, as the nanotechnology begins to repair systems. Dude. They’ve been dead for literally 100 years. I don’t give a shit HOW good Borg technology are, they cannot <strong>bring themselves back to life after dying a hundred years ago in a ship crash</strong>. And if they DID have that technology it wouldn’t be in random fucking drones, they’re replacable.</p>

<p>I’m not a fan of late-stage Borg, but now it’s even MORE late-stage Borg. People complain about Voyager? This is FAR worse.</p>

<p>The dude in charge says “let’s not freeze them again even though it might be dangerous, we can learn so much from them,” and is killed because of it. Good job, dog.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/aw3zAAY.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Enterprise is sent after the Borg when it escapes on the researcher’s ship, kidnapping them as well. Enterprise finds the Borg attacking a vessel, and saves them, but they were already injected with nanoprobes. Meanwhile, Archer finds that Cochrane talked about the Borg once while drunk.</p>

<p>The aliens wake up, are like “WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?” and then for some fucking reason IMMEDIATELY act like Borg, even though they’re not fully turned. They immediately can tubule Phlox, who’s infected with the nanoprobes now. That’s not how indocrination works.</p>

<p>I’m starting to think this episode is dumb. This isn’t consistant with normal Trek, OR with First Contact’s terrible stupid interpretation of the Borg as like, zombies.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/MXEaBfF.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The Borg tubules a computer and it magically morphs into a Borg system. What in the mother fuck? They also have energy shielding already. What in the WORLD. Archer has to send them out of the airlock, he’s extremely unhappy about it, but he intends to recover them, and save anyone if he can. Phlox, for the record, makes a fucking poison and goes “if I can’t cure this with this treatment I’m designing, kill me with this, thank you, I do not intend to turn into one of those”.</p>

<p>They find the Borg, and they manage to overpower Enterprise, of course. They then send a message. “YOU WILL BE ASSIMILATED. RESISTANCE IS FUTILE”. Notice, if you will, that they did NOT add “WE ARE THE BORG” at the start. Which is an important notable omission. They are desperate to maintain continuity here, but dude. Maybe if you need to work this hard to maintain continuity by CHANGING THE WAY THE BORG WORK IN EVERY WAY, YOU SHOULDN’T HAVE DONE THIS EPISODE.</p>

<p>Archer and Reed beam over, but don’t worry, it’s fine. They updated their weapons and made them powerful enough to take out the Borg. Dude. They couldn’t do that in VOYAGER, WITH A BORG ON THEIR SIDE, WHY CAN THEY DO THAT NOW????? They also disable a Borg Drone by pulling the tubules out of their heads. Wow its really fucking easy to kill a Drone.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/xhQkDme.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Archer decides he can’t save anyone on the ship, and sets a bomb. The ship is damaged, but alive, and they send over the borg they used to invade Enterprise to fix it. For some reason. That’s very dumb, cause Enterprise just blows it up and kills all of the Borg, gg.</p>

<p>Also Phlox is fine, he just had to suffer through a dangerous radiation bath. He warns them that the Borg were sending a message. somewhere deep in the Delta Quadrant… coordinates of Earth. If that ever comes back… it doesn’t. It’s not important.</p>

<p>This sucked. However, here’s a thing:</p>

<p>“The events of this episode form the basis of the story for the 2006 game Star Trek: Legacy. A Vulcan scientist named T’Uerell is assigned to study the Borg debris and after learning their true nature, injects herself with Borg nanoprobes. Armed with knowledge of future events, she spends the next two centuries building her forces and waiting for the opportunity to seize control of the Borg Collective in order to use them to bring a state of total logic to the Alpha Quadrant.”</p>

<p>what</p>

<p>Was that game any good? I doubt it.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="Enterprise" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 197</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/11/16/OOCY197.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 197" /><published>2025-11-16T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2025-11-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/11/16/OOCY197</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/11/16/OOCY197.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/2FtRkPu.png" alt="'" class="center-block" /></p>
