<p>Final Fantasy 8 is a very special game that I had never played, once, in my entire life. I own it, though. It fascinated me, so I picked it up hoping to get to it, but it took me probably about 13 years. This is a special one in the Final Fantasy Ouvre, because it’s extremely divisive. There are a lot of people who love it, consider it their favorite in the entire series. There’s also a lot of people who haaate it. It’s a bit of a blacksheep, the one to skip. As I play games on stream, I also read contemporary reviews of games, and there were some scaaathing ones for this one. When I was an impressionable younger kid, reading those reviews but not playing the game, I agreed with them. This game is the worst in the series, I said, until 13 came out and I played that. Then it was the 2nd worst. But now I played it. I have formed my own opinions. And my thoughts?</p>

<p>I think I like Final Fantasy 8 more than 7.</p>

<p>With THAT controversial take out of the way, let’s get right into it!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/v25cEbE.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Final Fantasy 8 is a very ambitious video game. It’s unique in Final Fantasy in many, many ways, all of which I will try to get to. Unique doesn’t neccesarily mean good, but you can respect the effort for a lot of them. There are a LOT of things to get to that FF8 does differently from both its immediate predecessor, and every other game in the series, but I think the first thing I want to talk about is mechanics.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy 8 introduces the Junction System. So, in universe, there are these things called GFs. Guardian Forces, I think, but we just kept calling them girlfriends, because it made for some very, VERY funny moments, like when the final boss exclaimed that they were using the MOST POWERFUL GIRLFRIEND. In game terms, this is a summon, essentially. These summons have their own levels and stats that they gain alongside you, and you “junction”, or equip, them to a character. The game has no other equipment aside from that, except for a minor weapon system that is less buying weapons and more crafting upgrades to them.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/95QiDn1.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Each girlfriend also has their own abilities they can learn. These are things like stuff to help when they’re summoned, active abilities like Mug or Darkside, Cecil’s power from FF4. Passive abilities, like Encnone, allowing you to bypass all random encounters. Stat abilities, boosting stats or letting you gain stats when you level up, WE’LL GET TO IT. And finally, most importantly, magic junction abilities. These are ones called like “Mag”, or “Vit”. These will allow you to junction magic to a character in that stat if they have this GF junctioned. So, you equip the GF as armor basically, giving abilities, but also the ability to equip more things to increase stats. Make sense? You can equip magic you get onto these stats, increasing them based on the magic you choose, and the amount. Some magic is better for stats than others. Life and Cure spells are good for health and defense stats, while big damage spells like Flare and Meteor are good for Strength and MAgic.</p>

<p>How do you GET these spells though? Well, that’s where the Draw system comes into play. Each enemy has some spells that they have equipped. You can then select the Draw ability, which is equipped via GF like any other ability, and you can draw those spells from that enemy to your personal stash. You can ALSO just up and cast them, good in a pinch, but they’re weaker this way. The amount drawn depends on your magic stat, from 1 to 9. This means on average, with a cap of 100, you will be drawing about 20 times for one spell, but more than likely only 11. This can be tedious sounding, and it kinda is, but it’s extremely important to be able to do anything.</p>

<p>You may be going, wow Liz, this sounds confusing. And it kinda is! This is the biggest hurdle to getting into FF8, because this system is REQUIRED to do ANYTHING. FF8 doesn’t increase your stats as you level up as much as most FF games do, and it doesn’t matter too, because as you level up, so do enemies. You need to constantly be swapping out Junctions as you progress with better spells, so you can keep up. And when you get to points where you need to swap characters, it gets VERY clunky. This system is, straight up, jank. Not to mention that it disincentivizes using magic, as it’ll lower your stats. But it’s also kinda fun?</p>

<p>It makes it kinda like FF7 where any character can be anything. You have base stats, but then you can fit them however you want. This is cool, and really fun to break. But if you dunno what you’re doing, it’s kinda frustrating. And even if you DO know what you’re doing, the clunkiness can get to you. Over all I felt it was a plus, though, and I respected them trying something new with this system.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/QFXsdAC.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>I should also mention with the gameplay is the limit break system. In FF6, limit breaks happened randomly when you were low on health. They took that system and changed it completely for FF7, giving you a bar and once it filled up, forcing you to limit break. FF8 returns to the FF6 format. The more fucked up your character is, the higher a chance of their limit break happening, and the better it is. Lower health, more status effects. These use no magic, and aren’t super long winded, though they are y’know, long unskippable cutscenes, they’re not at bad as the summons, which I’ll get to. This is, by far, the best way to deal damage. But this also means you need to try and stay hovering at low health for a lot of fights to get em done faster, which is hectic.</p>

<p>I also wanna talk about the summons. A lot of reviews I read said that the best and only way to fight enemies, cause normal combat is so weak and slow paced, is to just spam summons. But summons have like, minute long summoning cutscenes. There’s no real reason NOT to use them, they’re just slow. You choose to summon one, then you have like, a backwards ATB meter that counts down, and a Summon health bar. If that health bar goes down, the summon doesn’t come out. Then you watch a long-ass cutscene, and then they deal like, okay damage. No cost, nothing. Now, I used summons maybe four times in the entire game. Once to see what they were like, twice for an actual effect (doom train reduces enemy defense), and once to see what the final summons animation was. It’s 30 seconds longer than Knights of the Round in FF7 and is absolutely fucking nuts.</p>

<p>The summon system feels unneccesary and not super great, and I dunno what all those magazines were whining about. I think they just didn’t get the Junction system and weren’t playing very well.</p>

<p>ONE LAST gameplay thing, and that’s mini games. So, Final Fantasy games love their little minigames. Small gameplay things that don’t make any sense and barely fit into the world. FF7 had so fucking many of them. You snowboarded down a slope after burying your dead friend. Does FF8 have anything like that? Well, only one, but it’s built into the entire game, and that’s Triple Triad. It’s a pretty fun and well made card game, I like Triple Triad. And you can abuse those cards you win by modding them into good magic and items, which is cool as hell. If you wanna min-max like crazy, you are going to be VERY familiar with Triple Triad. I just got all the cards. It was a lot of card games.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/qyzcf59.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Next, let’s talk character and story. The main character of our game is Squall Leonhart. All my life, I heard the following. “It’s kinda public opinion that Cloud is an emotionless emo boy, but that’s not true. SQUALL is that, not Cloud”. I’ve now played this game and once again, much like Cloud, I feel like people only look at the surface and the first 10 minutes and decide that’s just what Squall is for the entire game. Now I’m curious to finish FF13 and find out if Lightning actually grows as a character.</p>

<p>Squall is a dork. He’s an anti-social teenager who responds “whatever” to things, but he’s actually just a fucking dork. It doesn’t help that we made his personality “extremely not into anything anyone else is doing, unless it fits his interests, which is card games” as a joke. He’s bad at communication, but is thrust into a leadership position rather suddenly, which he didn’t seem to want or care that much about. But he’s not emo, and he’s not emotionless, and he’s not a bad character at all. And by the end as you see him evolve, it’s great. In the final cutscene he calls out for his friends to help him. That feels like a minor thing, but that’s the culmination of his character development, it’s wonderful.</p>

<p>Squall is a child mercenary working for SeeD. SeeD is a special class of mercenary, trained by the three Gardens in the world. He’s joined by his fellow mercenaries from his garden, Quistis, one of the teachers who’s also a SeeD, his classmate Zell, a meathead who has Tifa’s moveset. They also meet Selphie, a slightly unhinged airhead from another Garden, and Irvine, the rootin’ tootin’ playboy cowboy from the last Garden, who’s actually extremely insecure and anxious about everything. It’s a good cast. But of course, we’re missing one more major character.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/cZqtOt0.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>This is Rinoa, the plucky but kind of in-over-her-head leader of an underground resistance group fighting against The Evil Empire. She hires Squall and his group to help her fight against the Empire, and that’s one of the big things this game does differently to most other Final Fantasy games. This game IS about typical final fantasy stuff, fighting evil empires and stopping a world ending calamity. But at its core, it’s a love story. It’s about romance between Squall and Rinoa. And at first I was like “These two? Yeah right”. And it felt a little forced and heavy handed. But honestly? By the scene where they’re dying in space, stranded in space suits (yes really), I REALLY felt it. It was good. And Rinoai s a really cute character. She kinda looks like someone wanted to just make Tifa again, but has mild prosopagnosia, but that’s fine. Character wise she’s cute. Also her limit breaks use her dog Angelo! Angelo no joke has the most broken limit breaks, and he saved the galaxy by defeating the final boss with his “make everyone invincible for a minute” ability.</p>

<p>The villain is interesting too, as a comparison to Sephiroth. I really didn’t care for Sephiroth very much. Didn’t find him interesting, and he basically wasn’t in 80% of the game. Our villain here is a fun contrast cause she’s also kinda like that. Kinda. But not. See, the villain Ultimecia feels like a late game reveal of “this is the bad guy all along”, but her fingers and influence has been felt for the entire game in a way I appreciate. The final dungeon is Kinda Fucked, but over all I liked her presence. And she’s got a great final boss. Halfway through the game you name Squall’s lion he has on his ring, and I named it “Liony the Lion” as a joke. Anyways Liony the Lion became the final boss and it fucking floored me.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Os22yA9.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Next let’s talk graphics. This game looks STUNNINGLY good for 1999 PS1. Like, yes, parts of it are chunky and look rough, like “best looking guy here” Squall up there. But over all, the in game graphics are quite good, and they move into FMV in a really seamless way that blew my mind multiple times with super cool sequences. And speaking of which, that FMV?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/heDfX8Y.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Really godo for the 90s. You can see some parts where it looks weird, or unnatural, but over all, it genuinely looks fantastic, and blew me away almost every time. Aesthetically, this game is on point. It’s also unique aesthetically. FF7 kinda mixed fantasy and sci-fi, but this is FULL on sci-fi, and it looks cool as hell.</p>

<p>The music is also really good. Not as good as FF7, I think, over all. But it’s got lots of great tracks. That final boss theme, The Extreme? Holy moly. Here’s the theme, by the way. It’s great cause it’s a surprise final boss phase after what seems like it was the last one, so it’s calm and peaceful as you’re like “Phew, it’s finally over”. AND THEN IT FUCKING KICKS IN. Head bangs the entire time.</p>

<p>One of those contemporary reviews I read about this game claimed that FF8 had the worst soundtrack of the entire series, and that it was a travesty, with no good songs at all. Look, no FF game has a bad soundtrack. Some have less standouts than others. But you cannot tell me the game with THIS SONG</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/orKgvGz2dHs?si=tX7aRK6mOOPtw_BQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>is the worst Final Fantasy soundtrack out there. FF4’s soundtrack is way, way more boring. FF4 does not have a Shuffle or Boogie.</p>

<p>Anyways yeah, don’t have much more to add. I think FF8 is clunky, and kind of a mess, but in a way that I GREATLY enjoyed and had a lot of fun with. It’s a mixed bag, but I understand what people see in it now.</p>

<p>Really excited to play 9, because I know SO little about 9 over all.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="PS1" /><category term="retro games" /><category term="Final Fantasy" /><category term="RPGs" /><category term="Reviews" /><category term="Unmastered" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Yuri Recommendation - Ouji-sama Nante Iranai</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/05/10/OOCYSuggestion.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Yuri Recommendation - Ouji-sama Nante Iranai" /><published>2025-05-10T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-05-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/05/10/OOCYSuggestion</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/05/10/OOCYSuggestion.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/W3XYZqk.png" alt="Two women looking at each other in a very straight way." class="center-block" /></p>

<p>So I’ve been recently staying up till 3AM reading this manga, it’s called Ouji-sama Nante Iranai, and I finished it last night, so I wanted to talk about it. I don’t do recommendations as much as I should, so here, here’s one</p>

<p>Ouji-sama Nante Iranai is the story of two highschool students, Yukino and Nobara. They are 1st year students at this fancy school that has a weird gimmick. It has two divisions. See, it’s a school for both super fancy rich girls, and also hard working scholarship girls. These are the Botan and the Shakuyaku, respectively. Many years ago, this division was basically because the Shakuyaku were the Botan’s lackeys and personal servants, but at some point a Shakuyaku was elected to be student president, and managed to give the Shakuyaku more freedoms and rights in the school. But this ALSO means that the relationship between the two divisions is… bad. Lots of infighting, lots of catty bullshit.</p>

<p>But there’s two students here. Yukino, and Nobara. Yukino is Shakuyaku, Nobara is Botan. Yukino comes from an “ordinary” family, Nobara’s parents are wealthy musicians. Makes sense. In a normal setting, these two would never meet or come together, and even in this setting, they wouldn’t neccesarily get along, considering the bad vibes. But on the first day, Yukino meets Nobara in the greenhouse, and is entranced by how beautiful she is. But like, in a straight way, you know.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/9OeOpcZ.png" alt="Nobara sleeping in the greenhouse" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Not only that, but due to a mixup, Yukino has to room with Nobara in the Botan dorms. Luckily, Yukino is a sweet young girl who just wnats to make people happy, and Nobara is a kind of emotionless doll who doesn’t really mind. They find each other fascinating, and what grows from their new friendship is something quite beautiful.</p>

<p>This story is, at its heart, the story of these two girls as they grow closer. Y’know, yuri. And it’s not like that “oh pure friendship between girls” kinda yuri, though the comic does address that at places, no, it’s pretty explicit. But not just that, but it’s about the political movings of this small school, the many students that inhabit it, and all of their personal relations. A school filled with students that hate each other slowly starts to come together, and it starts with Nobara and Yukino’s blossoming friendship.</p>

<p>This story has a lot of characters. Like, a loooot. And each of them has in depth backstories and character and motivations. Very minor characters who you wouldn’t expect get serious moments about who they love and who they want to be with. Like, for example, Yukino has a best friend from her old school. That best friend has a roomate, the ace of the school’s drama club. Okay, so she’s a minor character, but she gets a lot of indepth story is what you’re saying? Yes. But it’s more than that. We see this girl meet another girl and fall in love, but also at the same time, we get minor characters through THEIR connections. Later on there’s a school dance and they’re put into pairs, and the drama prince gets assigned a Botan who we’ve seen a few times as a background character. And she starts getting a crush, and suddenly it grows out from THERE. There’s a major love triangle between three minor characters. There’s a lot of things like this. You get like, 4 chapters for every minor character, showing their struggles and problems, with Nobara or Yukino (or both) helping them through it, as the school comes closer together.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Eg8oTBU.png" alt="Yukino waking Nobara up" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>At the center of it, though, there’s Yukino and Nobara. And it’s a cute sweet story. I like their characters. Yukino is a sweetheart who has MAJOR self worth problems, because she kind of tends to base her self worth on helping others and how much others like her. And Nobara is still suffering from the death of her parents a few years ago, which she blames herself for, and has walled herself off from the world. We watch them help each other through their problems and grow as people, it’s really heartwarming.</p>

<p>This is a rather long manga. 200 chapters. It’s in a long strip format, so it’s a LOT of reading. It took me several nights to finish, but I’m glad I did, it was really enjoyable, and I highly recommend it. If you like school drama, character drama, and of course social gap drama, you’ll like this one.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="oocy" /><category term="yuri" /><category term="Ouji-sama Nante Iranai" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Retro Achievement Mastery 173 - Winnie the Pooh in the Hundred Acre Wood</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/05/06/RA174-Pooh.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Retro Achievement Mastery 173 - Winnie the Pooh in the Hundred Acre Wood" /><published>2025-05-06T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-05-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/05/06/RA174-Pooh</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/05/06/RA174-Pooh.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/j5iduki.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Sierra On-Line was maybe THE Apple II dev. They made a lot of the most popular adventure games of the day, many of which you probably still know about, despite coming out almost 40 years ago. Games like King’s Quest, Space Quest, Police Quest, Leisure Suit Larry, Quest for Glory, Phantasmagoria, the list goes on. They were very, VERY big at the time. And around the growing height of their fame, in the mid 80s on their home town of the Apple II, they also made this.</p>

<p>It’s a simple text adventure with graphical components, mostly just a solid unmoving image. You move around a grid of a map, and sometimes into spaces on those grids like houses, in order to find items that are scattered around the Hundred Acre Wood. You then need to bring those items to their owners, who are scattered around, mostly in their houses. You are not Pooh in this, you’re just some random kid. There’s lots of spaces to explore, and every now and then the items move aroumd. They start randomized, and there’s a large pool of them but only 10 show up, so it’s technically different every time!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/DcahVU5.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>For an Apple II game, I have to give credit, this LOOKS good. Compare this to a lot of the other games like this, text adventures which have an image at the top of where you are, and it’s night and day. I can actually recognize Owl!! They clearly put actual effort into the art, which is not a surprise since they probably had Disney breathing down their necks, and Disney will NOT let you do off-model art.</p>

<p>Over all, this is a very simple but kind of cute kids adventure game, where the adventure is mostly wandering aimlessly and occasionally running into a character you like. I was a HUGE Winnie the Pooh fan as a kid, so I had some sense of whimsy playing this, but there’s not a whole lot to it. There’s a reason that despite Sierra On-Line being one of the biggest game companies of the time, I could find very, very little about this game online. Sierra has a lot of great games I wanna check out sometime, and a wonderful history that was sadly cut short in the late 90s when it was bought by some big-ass firm that fell apart quickly, like all those big ass firms that buy companies do. It then lost all its talent and became a shadow until finally being devoured by Activision, because capitalism is garbage. But at least we can still look back on its classics, like <em>looks at notes</em> Winnie the Pooh.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Apple" /><category term="Obscure games" /><category term="Winnie the Pooh" /><category term="Text Adventures" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sierra On-Line was maybe THE Apple II dev.

<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p>**Someone to Watch Over Me ** - VOY
8/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Zg5Olxh.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Seven is collecting research by staring at Torres and Paris. Torres asks her about it, and finds out she’s researching courting behavior. She reads the notes and is like “Why do you know when we’re having ‘intimate relations?’ Seven responds with ‘There is no one on deck seven who does not know when you are having intimate relations’ and almost gets her nose caved in.</p>

<p>Janeway suggests she just try to date instead. It’s maybe the gayest scene in Trek so far.</p>

<p>The Kadi are coming to visit! The Kadi are a species of conservative religious fundamentalists who lead an ascetic lifestyle. Their abbot dropps off one of them, a Kadi named Tomin. They have strict rules about what they can eat and do, but as soon as Tomin is alone he’s like “I’d like to try this spicy dish I heard about in your data files actually”. Yeah that makes sense.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/iOHzNTG.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Since the Doctor is Seven’s teacher in how to act like a person, he gives her dating lessons. At first it’s a little too narrow (she knows what sex is, doctor) to way too broad (Here’s a holographic guy, go flirt with him). It’s fun to see good actors try to be bad at things they’re good at. There’s no way Jeri Ryan wasn’t SWIMMING in dudes. Paris watches and comments that she’s a lost cause. Not that she couldn’t GET a date, half the crew apparently wants to jump her, but keeping a date is the hard part. The Doctor gets offended, and so they make a bet. Seven of Nine will show up to Tomin’s function with a date, and it will go WELL. I dunno about you, but I’m as into these stakes as all the ship blowy up ones.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/OxS7KSn.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Singing lessons! I dunno how this will get Seven laid, but the Doctor seems real into it. Real, REAL into it. He’s looking at her like… uh oh.</p>

<p>Kim got promoted from Person Seven Works With to friend! He offers her advice for some “candidates” she’s looking for for dating, based on her interests. “I didn’t know you had any interests.” “Neither did I, but apparently they include astronomy, physics, and music.” Funny.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/CyXJdKA.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We don’t have get to see Seven with her hair down very often, it’s nice.</p>

<p>She and this dude have a date. It’s a bit awkward, but certainly not TERRIBLE. They have a dance, and they’re both still awkward, but it gets better, until she gets a BIT too into it and tears a one of his ligiments, so he has to go home. Damn girl, how the hell did you pull that off? She laments that dating is a poor form of social interaction, it’s much better when it’s like it is with the doctor! When people just say what they mean. Did you know some people read Seven in an autism kinda way? No way, right? How strange.</p>

<p>Oh hey, remember Tomin? He’s fucking SMASHED on synthehol. Neelix didn’t even know you could DO that. He’s got holographic babes on each arm and is like “I’m thinking of leaving the convent and joining Voyager!!” Ohhh the alternate universe where they just kept picking up stragglers.</p>

<p>At Tomin’s party the next day, with Tomin still smashed beyond belief, Seven goes on a date with the Doctor. She’s doing well, and is almost the life of the party. Aaaand then Paris is like “well congrats doc, you won the wager” and she becomes, quite understandably, offended at the idea that the Doctor was just doing this for her for a bet. Which, yeah, fair.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/NnlH5Rf.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Tomin is drunk as hell and super horny for Seven. He begs her to assimilate him. Get in line, dog.</p>

<p>The Doctor tries to smooth things over with Seven, and it seems to go alright, but he’s now coming to terms with the fact that he has in fact developed feelings for her. So now HE goes to PARIS for advice. Paris is like “Just tell her how you feel, duh.” “What if she doesn’t feel the same way back?” “Always the risk you gotta take.” So he does. He confesses, and theeen it turns out it was just a holodeck program. Understandable, gotta practice first. And then the real Seven comes in, and tells him that while she appreciates what he’s been doing, they no longer need these social lessons, as there are no potential mates on the ship for her to persue. The Doctor sadly plays Someone to Watch Over Me on piano as the episode ends. Poor Doctor.</p>

<p>Good episode, if a bit sad.</p>

<p><strong>11:59</strong> - VOY
2/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/B9g40QH.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>I mis-saw this picture as Janeway with a rapier and got REALLY excited for a second</p>

<p>Neelix is infodumping about Earth to Janeway. Oh no he’s a Earthaboo. Apparently he’s been studying Earth and its many landmarks. Janeway asks him what he knows about the Millenium Gate (it’s some kind of self sufficient super building), and he lists the specifications of it, but she knows a bit more than that. Her ancestor is the person who built it, a woman named Shannon O’Donnel. And then it suddenly jumps to the past, the far off year of 2000, with Shannon O’Donnel. Wow, it’s a stealth Mrs. Columbo reboot.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/XvSKs4a.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>She’s driving through Indiana and her car breaks down in the middle of nowhere. Every store in town is completely closed, except one, a book store run by a Henry Janeway and his son. He’s a curmodgeonly guy, a luddite, who’s making signs to stop The Millenium Gate. He calls it a “glorified shopping mall”, and that its forcing businesses to close. He’s kind of unlikable, I’m not gonna lie. She endears herself to them and and gets hired to help make the fliers and things, because he refuses to use computers. My dude, it’s 2000.</p>

<p>They try and push a romance between Shannon, who’s basically just Janeway but in the year 2000, and this dude who looks like Rick Berman’s self insert, and acts like him too. And then the theme of the episode appears to be how important ancestry and geneology is. The ONLY thing keeping me here is that I like Star Trek period pieces and seeing actors in cool outfits, but even here it’s just… normal-ass clothing.</p>

<p>Anyways turns out Shannon was a NASA engineer who got fired because it’s America and we don’t treat the people who actually do good jobs well. The guy who’s trying to build the Millenium Gate hits her up and offers her a job, if she helps him talk his dad down. Basically, he’s the last hold out, and if he doesn’t sell the shop by midnight, they’ll have to move the Millenium Gate, which is SUPPOSED to help the town a lot. Not that Alex Jones over here cares.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/yaB7NAE.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They get into an argument about it, he’s as awful as he has been all episode. She later describes him as “listening to no one but himself” which is pretty accurate. And then we jump back to the future, where we’re talking more about family history and how important it is. But as she examines her history more and more, she starts to realize how malleable history is. Everything is biased by what people want to believe, so she’s digging through everything she can to learn more about Shannon, and she’s starting to realize that the family story of Shannon single handidly building the Millenium Gate and ushering Humanity into the future is pretty incorrect. She was just a consultant.</p>

<p>Shannon leaves the town, and then decides to come back and try one more time to convince him that he’s being a fucking idiot.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Xirah5M.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Why? WHY were you thinking about him? For the love of fucking GOD what do you see in this man? The fascist Janeway kissed from several episodes ago was more likable than this, because at least he PRETENDED to not be a piece of garbage. This is built on the romance, and the emotion of these two people but I can’t fucking stand him. His whole thing is “THIS IS MY SHOP I OWN AND I REFUSE TO MOVE IT” when they’re willing to help him move it, for free, into this new multiplex. Who the fuck gives a shit dude. This is like the “THIS IS OUR HOME” colonization episodes but way, WAY worse. Anyways he finally gives in at 11:59, and everyone lives happily ever after.</p>

<p>In the future Janeway is still disollutioned with everything, thinking Shannon not all that important in the grand scheme of things. But her crewmates convince her that it’s actually important, so okay, it’s important. There’s some stuff about “it’s not what she actually did, it’s her inspiration that rippled through time to you that’s important”, which I think is okay, that’s fine.</p>

<p>Over all though I really hated this. I didn’t really like any of its themes or think they were good, and then at its crux its a romance love story that is so, so, SO unpleasant. It’s not trash, but prolly my personal least favorite episode of Voyager so far, holy hell.</p>

<p><strong>Relativity</strong> - VOY
8.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/JAGIXIX.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We get Voyager being built in Utopia Planitia, and Janeway boarding it for the first time. Oh look at this crew, all bright eyed and bushy tailed, I can’t wait for them all to be alive. We see her walking around getting a tour from an admiral, and we see…. why, who’s that?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/rwSzSzW.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Seven of Nine is here in the past! She looks SO uncomfortable and unhappy to be here. She’s trying to find a “weapon” of some kind, and keeps calling in about how she has yet to find it, but keeps getting interrupted by y’know, the ship being a ship where people talk and exist on it. She finds the weapon, but can’t teleport it out, because it’s out of flux. Janeway catches wind of something happening in that space so she goes to explore, and whoever Seven is working with teleports her out, at risk of it possibly harming her. And it does, she dies in transport. Janeway also catches some chroniton readings, but that’s it.</p>

<p>The Captain of the Timeship is a man by the name of Braxton. Sound familiar? Maybe they’ll bring it up later. Anyways Braxton orders them to get a new one. We jump back to Voyager. Pretty chill day. Seven has hypochondria. There’s some cases of space sickness. Paris convinces Seven to join them for a ping pong tournament. Things get worse, as they find out it’s being caused by temporal distortions. They’re causing sickness, food spoilage, overall confusion as people call for help 7 minutes earlier than they need it. Oh also it’s starting to demolecularize the hull, that sounds bad. As the time cops show up, she catches wind of those same readings again. Janeway calls for an abandon ship, but it’s too late, as the ship explodes, just as Seven is teleported to the future.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/zE9PukF.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Braxton explains that someone at some point put a weapon on Voyager, and they need Seven to find it because she can actually determine temporal distortions with her ocular implants. Braxton also tells her to be careful of Janeway. She’s a loose cannon and cannot be trusted. She left him STRANDED in the past once, after he asked for her help! Yes, do you remember that? Braxton is, in fact, the guy who was FUCKING GOD AWFUL at time travel. He was the dude who almost killed Voyager for no reason, and then got stranded in the past, and became a hobo rambling about being from the future. The absolute fucking worst. His CO talks about how much he trusts his captain, but I have no fucking idea why.</p>

<p>They think the weapon might be planted during a battle with the Kazon, and they beam her in. Of course when Janeway senses the readings, she IMMEDIATELY goes hellbent on finding out what the fuck it is. They capture Seven, and Braxton in the future is like “GOD do not tell her anything” and of course Seven spills EVERYTHING.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/KU4RpyL.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They have a heart to heart. It’s Gay. They hunt down the ACTUAL sabateur and find out… it’s Braxton!! He’s suffering from temporal psychosis. He’s here to blow up Voyager because it destroyed his life. So, Temporal Psychosis is a thing that happens if they teleport you through time too much, you start to go a bit loony. Future Braxton is arrested for crimes he will commit, as futurer Braxton teleports away to another time, and Seven chases. She’s suffering from psychosis too, and after yet ANOTHER jump, she manages to destroy Braxton’s teleporter, before collapsing and asking Seven to help her.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/7jOsAg7.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They eventually get him, but need someone to fix the timeline after its been contaminated so heavily. So they snatch Janeway and send her back to get Braxton at the start before this all even happened. Braxton’s CO explains after its all done that he’ll be reintigrated in tiem for the court date, as will they. There will only be one Seven running around. Aww, I was hoping there’s be a Future Seven for the fans and books to geek about. He also begs them to stop time traveling so much.</p>

<p>This was a really fun episode. I love goofy time travel.</p>

<p><strong>Warhead</strong> - VOY
8/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/sCDEgJv.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Harry Kim is on night duty, and is sitting in the captain’s chair. He gets to be in the CAPTAINS CHAIR but he won’t be promoted past Ensign? Poor Kim. They get a distress call, and Kim orders they head towards it. He wakes Chakotay up, who puts him on away mission duty to find the distress call. He goes down with a no name and the Doctor, and they find a weird metal tube who speaks in what Neli says is an old TOS robot speech. Only the Doctor can communicate with it, though it seems to be able to understand English. It asks why it can’t feel its arms and legs, and begs for help. It apparently does not realize it’s an AI.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/N1O0X3c.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This is an ensign on the bridge who we see a bit but doesn’t seem to be a major plot point. She’s very cute, I wonder if she’s single. ALSO, Chokie has barely been in any of these episodes. He shows up, people bounce jokes off him, and he stands there and looks pretty. Good use of your Chakotay.</p>

<p>They beam the thing back onto Voyager to find out what it is, and cause the Doctor wants to help it. He becomes very attached to this thing. He explains to it that it’s an AI, and tries to befriend it. They then discover what it is. A nuclear bomb, basically. A smart bomb. They need to get rid of it before it blows up. The Doctor begs them to just operate on it, put it in the holo emitters instead, and deactivate the bomb. They do, but then everything goes to shit. It gets angry at what they’re doing, and takes over the Doctor, angry that they were trying to dismantle it. It remembers who it is now, and its mission. Its mission is to fucking kill people, and it demands Voyager ferry it to its target so it can blow it up.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/hRpc8xB.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We get Evil Doctor. Remember Evil Bashir from season 1 DS9? This is so much better. He’s willing to blow up if they stop him, and demands they help him. Kim and Torres are held hostage. Kim TRIES to talk it down, appeal to its better nature, but it doesn’t seem to work. It’s angry like, all the time.</p>

<p>A merchant they’ve worked with shows up, and offers to help. He’s like a smarmy used car salesman. Apparently the bomb was made by the Druoda, and he could sell it for a pretty penny. They’re uncomfortable with the ethics of it though and ask him to leave. His ship opens fire, but then the bomb sends an antimatter wave through the teleporter stream, a thing it can do I guess, and blows it the fuck up.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, other warheads lock onto Voyager and beam through space towards it. That’s prolly not good.</p>

<p>The bomb asks them to help it find out why its memory was jumbled, and they find evidence that the war is actually over, and HAS been for three years, and the bomb was recalled. It’s Very, VERY unhappy about this, because it’s so hellbent on doing what it was made to do, which is blow up these people. It refuses to learn any more about this.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/NCLs8Pe.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>An attempt to stop him fails, just as more bombs show up, willing to tow him to his destination. But they manage to convince him to put his memory back in, aaaand yes, the war IS over. When he tries to convince the other bombs to stop, they’re like “lol no”. There’s some really good flexing with Kim and the Doctor here. I also like the parallels, with Kim like “you’re just regurgitating what you were told to think!” while earlier on, and for a lot of his character, he’s been regurgitating what he was told to think by higher ups and been afraid to think for himself.</p>

<p>The bomb sacrifices itself to blow up the other bombs. Superman. Neli called that this would be an Iron Giant situation, and it sure is. Before the bomb goes, it tries to tell them not to mourn it. Its still saving lives by being a weapon. It’s just that its target changed. Kim thanks for the Doctor for teaching him that AI can become more than its programming, and we see the cute ensign one more time, and then it ends. Good episode, very Trek.</p>

<p><strong>Equinox</strong> - VOY
9.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/UfUUjOl.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We start by seeing a Starfleet vessel being attacked by Slimers. It’s brutal. They send out an SOS, whiiiich Voyager picks up! They chase after it and go to help. They get there, and the Equinox begs them to extend shields. They do, saving the ship, but no one responds to hails any longer, so they beam over to try and find survivors.</p>

<p>I’m a little surprised they’re so willing to jump into this ship considering I think things have pretended to be Starfleet out here… twice? For a trick? But I mean, any chance of finding others like they. And they do. There are life signs on board. They find a terrified ensign who’s like “But we’re the only Humans in the Delta Quadrant?” They find another who is kind of… numb to everything, and trapped under debris. He claims to have been there for two days. They find a third one who freaks out and thinks he’s under attack so they knock him out and beam him over. And finally, they find the captain on the Bridge. He says he was brought here the Caretaker. Well, turns out they weren’t the only ones then, huh.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/TGm3S2w.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They welcome them all on Voyager, and try to help fix up the ship, while also figuring out what’s up with these aliens that are trying to kill them, some dimensional travelers. Half of the crew is suffering from PTSD. That girl they found refuses to go in elevators cause there’s nowhere to run in there, so she travels through jefferies tubes.</p>

<p>Their CO, Maxwell, makes some suggestions on how to capture the dimensional aliens. Build a net. They built a thing that brought them into our reality for several minutes. Oh my fucking god what the hell did you do to these aliens???</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/90gNRTt.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>It’s pretty clear how this is going to go. Captain Ransom and his CO Max are whispering about not letting these bright eyed and bushy tailed lucky fuckers know what happened. Ransom and Janeway butt heads a bit, not sure who has authority, and Janeway explains that based on protocol, it’s her. But Ransom is like “Hmmmm, do those protocols even matter here in the Delta Quadrant?” Uh, yes, dude. Yes they do. Anyways there’s basically four Equinox members we need to care about. Ransom, his CO Max, the claustrophobic ensign, and the chill engineer Seven saved.</p>

<p>The Equinox crew plans to steal something from Voyager and return to Equinox, because they’re “going home”. Okay y’all. Meanwhile, Janeway assumes the worst. She’s sensing the Sus energy wafting off all of them, and determines that they intentionally made their science facility impossible to enter with radiation. So they just send the Doctor in instead.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/1wZyiQi.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The Doctor finds some alien corpses. They’re turning the aliens into fuel. It was pretty clear what was going on, but damn, dog. That’s dark. Janeway confronts them, and we learn that in Equinox’s darkest day, they were saved by some aliens who blessed their travel by invoking spirits. These spirits were some nucleogenic lifeforms. They tried to study them, killed one by accident, and then realized what they could do. Janeway is diiisguuuusted, and relieves him of duty, and confines them all to quarters. They DO get the claustrophobic ensign to help them, cause she genuinely regrets ever having done any of this. But she just couldn’t ignore a command from her captain!</p>

<p>The Doctor activates the other EMH. Unfortunately, they deleted his ethical subroutines, so he takes out the Doctor. That’s not good. He infiltrates Voyager and goes to rescue Ransom. OH and the Clasutrophobic ensign is still working with them. Captains orders :).</p>

<p>They manage to get away, with Seven still on board, as the aliens attack. One charges at Janeway….</p>

<p>TO BE CONTINUED. Of course. You better watch out, Ransom. You stole Seven. Janeway hunted down the fucking BORG QUEEN for her, you ain’t shit.</p>

<p>This was very, very interesting, and I liked it a lot. I love the concept. I once was gonna do a Star Trek tabletop thing and suggested making a ship and thrusting them into what Voyager went through and seeing how they’d handle it. This is that. It’s nice to see as a mirror, and what could happen. But also what could happen if the people were weaker, weren’t giving it their all. Ransom kept talking about how Voyager was soft, how they didn’t go through what he did. Dog, it wasn’t called The Year Of Pretty Alright. And you follow that up by talking about how after a shitty time you met some friendly aliens who gave you food? Dude.</p>

<p>He’s awful, but refuses to accept it. He’s not even “what Janeway could be if she gave up her morals”, because she wouldn’t. She would never stoop to that level, because she’s who she is. He’s who he is. And he was not built for this, at all.</p>

<p>It’s also really fun to look into cause like, so, a lot of people hate Janeway and are like “WHY DIDN’T SHE JUST DO THIS AND THIS AND THIS TO GET BACK FASTER, JUST GIVE UP YOUR MORALS, YOU’RE IN THE DELTA QUADRANT NOW, WHO CARES”. Did they watch this episode? Are there “Captain Ransom Did Nothing Wrong” apologists out there? Can I hate them, because I already do.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="Voyager" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 140</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/05/04/OOCY140.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 140" /><published>2025-05-04T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-05-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/05/04/OOCY140</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/05/04/OOCY140.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/2tHR7sl.png" alt="A butch wraps her arms around another girl'Aaaaya... san!

<p>Alright, this is much more my speed than the previous two Apple games. This is Pooyan, a very classic arcade game by Konami from the early 80s. We’ve actually got quite a few arcade ports on the Apple II. Name a game from that era, they prolly tried to make a port of it. Keyword being try.</p>

<p>Most arcade ports to the Apple II do NOT work, in my opinion. The hardware is just so limited that movement and control is stilted, awkward, and stiff. For fast paced action games, it feels AWFUL. I’m talkin’ things like Dig Dug, Mario Bros, Pac-Man, even arcade inspired games that require fast twitch movement, absolutely horrendous. But Pooyah is prolly the best of these I’ve played.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/54q1IM0.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>In Pooyan, you play as a mama pig trying to protect her kids from a straight up horde of hungry wolves. They come equipped with balloons, and are trying to get down to the bottom, or up to the top of a tree, depending on the round. You move up and down on an elevator, and are trying to shoot them down with a bow and arrow. Occasionally you can grab some meat, which allows your shots to kill instantly and pierce. You need to hit the wolve’s balloons, and not them, so it takes some tricky precise aiming, though you get plenty of chances, cause they need like 4 or more wolves to get through to win, and you can usually spam a bit.</p>

<p>The thing that makes Pooyan on Apple II better than its contemporaries is that you’re really only controlling up and down. It gets stuck and awkward sometimes, but it’s SO much better than anything else I’ve tried to play. And again, you can spam a lot, which helps. To get FAR and survive, you need to be precise, but you can get by with a little luck and spam.</p>

<p>In the arcades, Pooyan is a tricky but great forgotten gem. Here, it’s just a pretty okay port. I’d certainly NOT recommend this version, but it’s doing its best, and I respect it for that.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Apple" /><category term="Obscure games" /><category term="Pooyan" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alright, this is much more my speed than the previous two Apple games. This is Pooyan, a very classic arcade game by Konami from the early 80s. We’ve actually got quite a few arcade ports on the Apple II. Name a game from that era, they prolly tried to make a port of it.

<p>Mind Castle is a 1984 text adventure by MCE where you’re exploring an abandoned mansion, which is said to contain treasures. As you enter, you are accosted by some kind of spirit that challenges you to a game. Solve his puzzles, and you can reach the top of the mansion and gain the treasure.</p>

<p>Along the way, you’ll explore the rooms in typical text adventure fashion, typing east, west, etc. Every room you enter has a new puzzle, usually based on that room you’re in, and you can ask for that room’s puzzle. Your host then gives you a puzzle, and it’s usually logic puzzles. And its USUALLY logic puzzles that are trying to troll you.</p>

<p>Here’s an example. This puzzle says a Zebra is on its way to the river, and sees a bunch of other animals. How many animals in all were going to the river? Well, one. There’s a LOT of puzzles like that. Over all, the puzzles are trolly, but not bad. There were a few that stumped me, but not for too long. This IS a kid’s game, after all. There’s also nothing here that’ll make you scratch your head for hours. In terms of Text Adventures, this is one of the easiest. There’s no like, over arching puzzles, everything is held to each room, and you just need to solve all the puzzles to climb the stairs to the next floor.</p>

<p>While this game won’t sit with me forever, for what it is, it’s quite enjoyable. I also love the ugly Apple II art, as I always do. Look at that fucking Giraffe.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Apple" /><category term="Obscure games" /><category term="Mind Castle" /><category term="Text Adventures" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mind Castle is a 1984 text adventure by MCE where you’re exploring an abandoned mansion, which is said to contain treasures.
