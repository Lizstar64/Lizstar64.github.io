<p>This is another big grower. In my mind, I compare this extremely heavily to Golfaria, as they’re both very similar. Both are metroidvania-esque games. Both involve exploring out, but with a limited resource for exploration so you have to go back to base a lot. And exploration is EXTREMELY unpelasant, until get a few powerups and have some leeway in case of mess ups.</p>

<p>In Porgy, you play as Rashmi, a marine biologist exploring the ocean in her submarine, the Porgy. The fish in the ocean have recently grown aggressive, and she wants to figure out why! This is a far more traditional metroidvania, or as I assume they call them in this universe, “porg-em-ups”, or “porglikes”. Your sub floats around, and can shoot torpedos to stun fish. You have fuel, which is also your health, and if it runs out, boom you splode. Your goal is to spread out, try and find fuel and weapon upgrades, and other power ups that can make your exploration easier. Like I said, exploration fucking sucks ass at the start, but it was immediately better than Golfaria, because while they both have that painful exploration is required bit, at least Porgy is a simple like, run and shoot kinda thing, and not a weird-ass golf game where you also need to learn new controls. Porgy is much easier to pick up and play.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/cCyoADq.png" alt="Porgy" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Once you get past that opening hump, Porgy is actually very pleasant and fun to explore. It’s quite large, took me five hours to 100%, and I resorted to a map for the last bit, and it STILL took me a while. It doesn’t help that you need to return to the surface every single time you get anything, which slows things down a lot. And combat really, really does suck at the start. Your weapons are weak and awful and awkward to use, and there’s no real need for it. So you have three things you can do. 1) Take a hit, which prolly means you’ll waste your time and fail this exploration dive. 2) Take a long time trying to avoid it, which wastes time, and you’ll prolly get hit anyway. 3) Kill it, which takes a long time for no reward, but at least it’s dead for the way back now. But after you refuel, everything respawns.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/k357Qnr.png" alt="Porgy" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>This game is rather huge, and a lot of the stuff is extremely well hidden. It really was fun by the end, but I won’t deny when I first palyed it I legit kind of hated it. I got ANGRY. Especially since big bosses just roam each area, and if they appear in your path on your way back with that fuel you so desperately need, you’re pretty much fucked, do it again, slut.</p>

<p>The ending is also fucking confounding, in a way I really don’t want to spoil, but also what the actual fuck??</p>

<p>Also, there’s Tao Nemuru in the credits again! Huh, I wonder what that’s all about :)</p>

<p>This is maybe the weirdest game in the entire pack, which is saying something considering the pack has Barbuta, Mooncat, and Divers.</p>

<p>I want you to imagine something, for a minute. Imagine it is alternate universe 1986. You go to Blockbuster and see a game on the shelf called “Waldorf’s Journey”, which has a cute walrus on the front. Oh boy! You love Walruses, this looks like a cute little adventure game! You bring it come, plug it in… you’re greeted with a shattered world with floating platforms and music that, while beautiful, is kind of… haunting, uncomfortable, dreamlike… You’re a little walrus, and there’s a sign near you. You move over to the sign, and read it, and it say’s the following:</p>

<p><strong><em>“THEY’RE COMING FOR YOUR TEETH”</em></strong></p>

<p>You’d be under your bed crying all night. That’s this game.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/FHC9MBq.png" alt="Waldorf's Journey" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>This game is a creepy pasta. Someone concepted this game as a fucking creepy pasta. This game wasn’t made, it spawned in a garage sale sold by a creepy old man who disappeared immediately after you bought it, and no one remembers him living there.</p>

<p>In Waldorf’s Journey you play… Waldorf, a cute Walrus who’s just a normal-ass Walrus. And he’s having a dream. The closest thing I can compare this to is a “Getting Over It” style game. You can control Waldorf’s angle and his jump, as he jumps between platforms, trying to get to the end of the dream. You can flap a bit to control yourself in the air. It’s almost golf-like. Yopu have a meter to control your flapping, which when it runs out, you’re flying blind, but you can regain power by eating fish. You’ve also got shells you can pick up, which you can spend on items from shops. There’s also puffins, which will save you if you fall. Your goal is to get to the end. The game is NOT long. It’s literally like a minute long as its shortest. I won’t spoil it, because it’s quite goofy in a way I love, and it’s one of my favorite games.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/B886f61.png" alt="Waldorf's Journey" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Waldorf’s Journey is very simple, and that CAN be bad. To some people it might feel like this is almost a nothing of a game. But to me, it’s weird-ass energy SELLS it, and I fucking LOVE it. God bless Waldorf.</p>

<p>There’s one other interesting thing to mention about this game…</p>

<p>This game gives special thanks in the credits to “Tao Nemuru”. This is the first time he’s ever mentioned, and while he currently is not affiliated with the company, Tao Nemuru is about to become EXTREMELY important to the story of UFO Soft. I’ll get into him later, once it becomes explicitely relevant.</p>

<p>Warptank is mayb ethe MOST like an NES game to me. It feels EXTREMELY like an NES game you’d play from like 1987. For 1985 it feels really ahead of its time, but it’s a damn good game.</p>

<p>In Warptank, you must save the world from the evils of Big Tank. You do this by going into the different parts of a space station, and sever its ties to “Capsule World”. There are several different levels you can go into from a big central connecting map. It’s not a complex setup, though it’s actually SHOCKINGLY big. This game is WAY larger than I expected. There are over 25 levels. That is a lot of god damn levels.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/hrF9HO3.png" alt="Warptank" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>You play as a little tank. The warp tank! You move along, and can press B to shoot and A to warp between the ceiling and the floor. If you warp successfully (the floor is actually there, or nothing is in the way), you’ll appear on the ceiling. So you’ve got to move along, dealing with enemies and hazards as you find a way to proceed, using slopes to move between floor/ceiling and wall/wall. It’s a good puzzly action… platformer, kind of? It’s EXTREMELY creative and enjoyable.</p>

<p>In each level there’s also, what else, COFFEE to collect! Collect them all for a bonus level. It’s very similar to Campanella in that regard, the coffee is in little hidden nooks.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/DMwUInq.png" alt="Warptank" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>The music and aesthetics are on point, though after my friend told me “the music can be sung to the cadence of the Mr. Bucket jingle”, it was COMPLETELY RUINED for me. 100% fucking ruined. Still good, though.</p>

<p>This game is long, and can be a little challenging at points, but it’s never unfair with unlimited lives and constant forward movement. One of the best games in the pack.</p>

<p>Every game company needs a Mario Kart, right? Well it’s not really Mario Kart-ish. It’s a very 80s feeling racing game, to me.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/pyefDKN.png" alt="BellRace" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Made in literally two weeks, using the same system from Campanella to try and cash in on the success, this game expands the Campanella universe by introducing some new characters! Most aren’t important, except for Pilot’s sister, Isabell, who will become more important later on. All of the characters are exactly the same, there’s no difference other than their color and the ending screen they get, which is the same for everyone except that it has your character on it.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/WQgnc9y.png" alt="BellRace" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>The Big Bell Race is a very simple racing game that FEELS like it was made in 2 weeks. Using Campanella’s controls, you zoom through a level while smacking opponents and avoiding getting smacked. You have three health, and if you die, you start your lap over, which can basically ruin chances of getting first, unless you are VERY far ahead. And you probably will be. The AI is dumb and bad at their job. They’re just straight up slower than you. There’s also power ups you can find which increase your attack power or make you spawn bombs, stuff like that.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/eRRUTwF.png" alt="BellRace" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>It’s a VERY simple racing game. Too simple, honestly. I do like Campanella’s controls, they’re smooth and silky, but there’s literally zero reason to play this after you get 1st in every race.</p>

<p>5.5/10. It sure is a game. One of the more interesting things about it is that it still uses LX Systems, but in the credits, says it was made by UFO Soft. They were starting to move over to that name.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="Reviews" /><category term="UFO50" /><category term="Reviews" /><category term="Modern Games" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">UFO 50 Retrospective Part 18 - Golfaria</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/reviews/2024/10/13/UFO50-18.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="UFO 50 Retrospective Part 18 - Golfaria" /><published>2024-10-13T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-10-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/reviews/2024/10/13/UFO50#18</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/reviews/2024/10/13/UFO50-18.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/PCuObP8.png" alt="Golfaria" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>I think no game grew on me more over the course of my playing it than Golfaria. When I first played Golfaria, I really didn’t like it. I played it more, and realized I kiiind of hated it? It was in D tier in my first tier list. But the entire time I was playing it, I was like “there’s something I’d love in here, something extremely fun and creative, it’s just REALLY hard to get to that point”. But when you FINALLY do, yeah. Yeah it’s fun and creative.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/PpJ36Hk.png" alt="Golfaria" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Golfaria is a top down Metroidvania-esque game, though I’d honestly liken it more to Zelda than to Metroid. It’s an action adventure game, where you play as a golf ball, awakening deep in the earth after who knows how long, with no memories, that you know of. You enter the world of Fairway, a beautiful realm, filled with sentient golf balls, horrible bugs called “Bogies”, birdies and eagles, and robo-birds that watch your every move and give you lore when you destroy them. What’s your goal? You don’t know. Just… go exploring.</p>

<p>The only problem is that exploring is awful, and is not fun to do, at all, when you first start. The game is a top down golf game, think something like Kirby’s Dream Course though not quite that advanced. You can only hit the ball forward, no smacking it up into the air, unless you’re in sand or a hole. You have only a certain number of strikes to get the ball to where you want to go, and again, it’s the start of the game. You don’t know where you want to go, yet. With only 20 strokes you need to go exploring. Those strokes can be improved by finding golf clubs, though good luck finding those, and healed by hitting birds, killing bogies, and finding safe zone flags, but good luck finding those, too. The game DOES kind of lead you in the right direction for a good upgrade to help make things easier, but it still took more percise suggestions to get there for me.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/zHxmpt9.png" alt="Golfaria" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Once you get past that hurdle though, and go through the first few dungeony areas with a few more clubs to increase your health, the game opens up in a way that’s really nice. The game controls really roughly at first, and you fly all over the god damn place, but once you get the brakes, holy shit it controls so much better. I do like the aesthetics and graphical design, but holy fuck it’s hard to tell which way slopes go sometimes, so you go all over which way. You can figure it out by studying the map with A, which shows you the direction of slopes, but it took me a bit to learn that.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Golfaria is a land of contrasts. As I knew, there’s a lot of fun to be had here, and I really did enjoy exploring it all to find 100% of the items. But it takes a bit to get there. Just be patient, don’t be like me.</p>

<p>Here it is. The big one. This is the most influential game in the entire catalogue. Campanella would be their big breakthrough hit, possibly saving the company from bankruptcy, and influencing a complete brand change, as by the following year, they’d have changed their name from LX Systems to “UFO Soft”. But for now, this is still an LX Systems game.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/jJYqCb0.png" alt="Campanella" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Campanella is a continuation of Zoldath. Kinda. Meesha Danry is credited as having the idea to bring the pilot and little red UFO back from Zoldath, thus saving the company’s most iconic characters. The game is a… platformer, kind of?? You control the little UFO, which will fall with the force of gravity. You can hold A to boost yourself upwards, so it’s kinda like a sort of swimming control. It’s very, VERY smooth, and controls extremely well. While you’re burning fuel, however, you’re uh, burning fuel. Run out, and you’ll crash to the ground. To keep this from happening, you need to defeat enemies, break blocks, and collect orbs, which increase your fuel. One hit from anything, including walls, will kill you, so you need to be careful as you fly around, but the crux of the game is that you gain lives REALLY easily just from score, so it becomes a gamble of “how risky do I get to get a high score, which will keep me playing?”</p>

<p>Campanella was made by Petter and his team of Gregory Milk, Chiffon Bola, and Shayn North, and they all did a fantastic job. The game looks amazing, it kinda reminds me of Gimmick aesthetically. It also sounds great, music by Petter himself. That 2nd world music is FANTASTIC.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/vnndcID.png" alt="Campanella" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Another fun thing about the game is that it introduces a 100% category involving coffee. Once again, coffee makes its appearance as little collectibles. You fly around a level, and if you fly into a certain spot in each level, coffee will spawn elsewhere and you can collect it. Get it all for the 100% ending. How do you FIND the coffee? Sometimes it’s just about randomly, but usually you can get an idea, just by looking at what areas of the map would be useless to go to. Getting all the Coffee makes the game a little easier, IMO, because you get so many lives just from the 500 points the coffee gives you.</p>

<p>Campanella was the breakout hit that LX Systems needed, and deserved. And while it is not my personal favorite game of their’s so far, or even IMO the best (I’d put Magic Garden, Kick Club, and Camouflage above it), it is extremely enjoyable, and worth a play.</p>

<p>This was the second game I finished, which look longer and more brain power than Magic Garden. I 100%’d it in a single sitting, which is a good sign.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/eSpcV7G.png" alt="Camouflage" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Camouflage is a unique puzzle game, where you play as a lizard. The gods of this world, the sun and the raincloud, believe you have it too easy, and cannot evolve this way, and so they introduce hazards to your environment. But to make things fair, they give you a gift: The ability to change your color, so you can blend into the world around you!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/gKclsaV.png" alt="Camouflage" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Each level of Camouflage drops you into a world of differnet colored backgrounds. You can press B to shift to the color of that background, which allows you to avoid the sight of any enemies while on that background. You can press A to see where enemies can see, which is massively helpful. Your goal is to escape to the exit, maybe while also grabbing all the extra collectables along the way. There’s two oranges and a baby on every level, and the baby basically makes you 2x as long, which makes puzzle solving to escape all the more complicated.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/xMOSfZ0.png" alt="Camouflage" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>The game is a lot of pattern recognition, and when the alligators come into play, some light action, because while the frogs are basically sentries you must avoid, the gators are always on the move, as sentries, so some puzzles involve using them as cover from frogs and whatnot. The game is extremely interesting and fun the entire way through, nothing challenging, but a nice brain tickler, lots of “Aha, THERE’S the way through” moments.</p>

<p>It’s also got a cute backstory to it. Gerry Smolski’s mother made a children’s book that went unpublished, we all know what that’s like tbh, so they made it into a game. This game does have very “children’s fable” energy to it, ESPECIALLY with the ending, which I will not spoil. It’s a really good one, highly recommended.</p>

<p>My first mastery since Cohost closed, and also my first mastery in two weeks, since I went so extremely hard on UFO 50. But I’m back. It’s the spoop month, so what better month to work on some spoopy games?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/QKNTdRe.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Soul Void Redux is a remaster of a sort of the game Soul Void, a free homebrew horror Gameboy game by artist Kadabura. It’s a bit of a walking simulator, with only EXTREMELY light gameplay beyond walking around and talking to things. I’m talkin’ avoiding enemies that walk across the screen in simple patterns in like, 3 different screens simple. It’s not about the gameplay. To me, this game is art more than a game. It’s about the art, the style, and the emotions that it can bring out with its story and dialogue.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/d5LwlWw.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Soul Void is a psychological horror game. You play an unnamed character, only referred to as “Girlie” or “Outsider” by others. You have fallen to somewhere called the void, where lost souls go instead of moving on to the next part in their journey. No one knows why, but they’re stuck here, and as they last longer and longer here, their anxieties, worries, and fears begin to eat away at them, and they start to lose themselves to it. The game is about those anxieties and fears, and how they are not the end, and they don’t have to control us.</p>

<p>You play a character who you see very little insight into, except for a few things that show that she is mentally not okay, and is extremely depressed, anxiety ridden, and barely able to function, and yet she takes time out of her day to help others instead of herself. And that’s what you do. You travel this world, finding people in varying stages of body horror as they devolve into their base emotions and fears, and you try to help them through it. You find a being who’s created a “factory”, because if they’re not doing something or working hard, SOMETHING is wrong, and they WILL explode. Of course, that’s not true, and they know it, but it’s the only way to keep them from freaking out. You need to help them walk away.</p>

<p>While the game is extremely dark, as it explores and discusses the most dark things that we can do in our psychosis, it is also very optimistic and warm, in that it’s about overcoming those things, and moving past them. Helping ourselves, as well as others. It’s extremely good. And the art is FANTASTIC. I really can’t stress that enough. The art is dark but beautiful, and very interesting. It is, of course, horror. Body horror is everywhere. But it’s intriguing in its morbidity. And the music is quite good too, very dark and fitting. Almost industrtial, in parts, coming out of my gamed boy.</p>

<p>Soul Void is a game that kind of wears its influences on its sleeve. Literally, there is a room that is just references to games the creator likes and is influenced by. Which is cool! Does it deserve to stand alongside these greats like Off, Undertale, and Yume Niki? I mean, I thought it was extremely good, and for a free game, it’s worth your time. It’s not long, so if you’ve got an hour or two to spend, it might make you think for a bit about how you handle yourself. Also the dialogue is quite good and shockingly funny at points, for a game about suicidal anxiety ridden people.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Homebrew" /><category term="Gameboy" /><category term="Soul Void" /><category term="Walking Sims" /><category term="Horror" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 23</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/10/13/OOCY23.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 23" /><published>2024-10-13T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-10-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/10/13/OOCY23</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/10/13/OOCY23.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/MAOIfcQ.png" alt="&quot;I'm gonna do it!
