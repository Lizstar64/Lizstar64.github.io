<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p><strong>Latent Image</strong> - VOY
7.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/JgcTc5k.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The Doctor is taking holo images of everyone, which he can use for medical research. He gives an example to Kim about this, showing that he can look at Kim’s spine without having to like, slice him apart, using the holo imager. As they examine his spine, the Doctor notices a weird incision that’s the sign of a neural surgery, and with a technique he developed himself. Neither he, nor Kim, remember this surgery. Uh oh.</p>

<p>The doctor talks to Janeway about it, who’s been avoiding the doctor, seemingly just cause she doesn’t like any medical stuff. She’s like “weird, I’ll schedule a scan for you but we’re a bit busy now.”. Then he goes to Seven of Nine, asking for her help. She agrees to do a diagnostic. When she comes back the following day, however, the doctor is like “what diagnostic?” Someone erased his memory. He doesn’t even remember that he found the incision on Kim. Something’s rotten in the medbay.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/AaHEjPc.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They try to go through the doctor’s photography album. It’s been deleted, though they find scraps that they can piece together to show a happy ensign on her birthday. Seven digs through the Doctor’s memory and finds that he doesn’t actually have it deleted, just locked. So he remembers snippits now. Them going on a mission, getting attacked by an unknown species.</p>

<p>He goes to the captain, and believes they’re all in danger, because he believes this alien attacker could still be nearby. Janeway tells him no, go shut down, she’ll take care of it. Instead, he sets up a chain of events where his memory will be restored if deleted, and then images taken of whoever entered. The camera has a blinking lights so whoever comes in must be an idiot for ignoring it- oh it’s Janeway.</p>

<p>The Doctor gets his memories back, and starts freaking out on the bridge about a conspiracy. Janeway explains that 18 months ago, SOMETHING happened that caused the doctor’s program to fall apart. So to avoid that memory coming back and causing problems, they’ll just erase his program. Without his consent. He’s like “That goes against my rights” and they explain he has no rights.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/W4aByk0.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Seven is disturbed by this, and talks to Janeway about it. She’s like “I’ve already decided it. And I’m in the right to, because in the end, the Doctor may SEEM Human, but he’s not. He’s just a program. He has no rights”. JANEWAY. WHAT THE FUCK. WE SOLVED THIS IN SEASON 2 OF TNG.</p>

<p>Seven admits that she’s almost more like a computer than a Human, sometimes, and is disturbed by what Janeway is doing. And they basically made HER a human, and did the same to the Doctor. Now he STILL doesn’t have rights?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/3xl1rA5.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This immediately wakes Janeway up, thankfully, who goes to the Doctor and explains that she was biased when she made her decision. At the very least, the Doctor has the right to know WHY they’re doing what they’re doing. Thank GOD. It sucks that they wrote her that way from the start, but at least it knows she’s wrong.</p>

<p>They reawaken his memories. Basically, this girl, Kim, and the Doctor went on the shuttle, and were attacked by an unknown alien. That alien hit them all with a weapon. It did nothing to the Doctor, but hit the other two, nearly killing them. Back on Voyager, the Doctor has to do surgery on them to save them. He can only choose one, however, and chooses to save Kim. Obviously. The ensign dies. Back in the future, the doctor is confounded why this would make him fall apart. He’s programmed to be able to handle shit like that.</p>

<p>They show him more. He’s having a meltdown over it. Not cause someone died, but because of his choice. Not that he had to make a choice, but how he made it. He chose the person he was closer to, Harry Kim. He feels like he failed, because that was never in his programming, it wasn’t logical. They did, indeed, make him more human, and he’s struggling with it. He gets caught in a loop. He is NOW in the future, too. He WANTS them to reprogram him again. But maybe there’s a better way this time?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/zHf0DEu.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They try a therapy situation, basically. Trying to let his program work through it, maybe get out of the loop. Janeway stays up late in the holodeck trying to talk him through it, which doesn’t seem to be helpful. It’s a slow process, though, and he’s slowly working through it. Slowly.</p>

<p>I dunno how to feel about this episode. I thought it was good. My watch partner, Neli, LOVED it. One of her favorite episodes in Voyager. She loved how it actually tackled death and trauma, a thing that Trek doesn’t tackle very well. Neli suggested that Janeway was the way she was earlier because she was trying to convince herself, and that she did it cause it was an easy way to help the Doctor get through his trauma. That… maybe? I didn’t see it that way, at all. I think she fucked up and then realized she fucked up. I dunno, I liked it I guess.</p>

<p><strong>Bride of Chaotica!</strong> - VOY
10/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/56XEgB6.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Paris and Kim are playing Captain Proton in the Holodeck. It’s a program Paris made that’s based on old shitty black and white serials. Low budget, very very funny. They go through it for a bit, occasionally making comments (“This is the same world we went to last week?” “Hey, sets were expensive.”), when they see a weird effect in the holodeck.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/QvXqaRV.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Basically, Voyager slammed into an “interstellar sandbar” that locked them in place. Whatever’s happening in the holodeck seems to just be harmless space phenomena, whatever, no big deal. Anyways it is a big deal.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/UzMaiYN.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Some people teleport into the holodeck, and are like “We come in peace, looking for other photonic life forms”. DOCTOR CHAOTICA announces WAR on these creatures, and now an armed conflict has broken out in the Holodeck. When Voyager finds out, it seems kinda nonsensical. Tuvok is SO checked out from all of this, it’s VERY funny. Vulcans have endless patience, but early 1900s media is close to running through it. Now they need to either convince these aliens they’re boxing shadows (hard since the aliens don’t think they’re real), or help them beat Chaotica so that that the Holodeck will end the program.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ti8VJdu.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Here’s Janeway’s expression to being told more about the holoprogram. It’s so fucking funny. She’s enlisted to play QUEEN ARACHNIA, another villain in the story, who can maybe stop CHAOTICA from within.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/O8S0MUn.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/MdXyghK.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This episode is so much fun</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/zF8pR56.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Here’s the Doctor playing “The President of Earth”, with his little patch. He asks the aliens for help. They need to lower their weapons so that Captain Proton can attack Chaotica. But only if Janeway on the inside can get him to lowering his lightning shield!</p>

<p>She’s captured, but manages to use her pheremones to escape. She takes control, they defeat Chaotica, and the distortions close. It ends with a little “The end…..?” with Chaotica laughing over it as it fades to black.</p>

<p>Fucking fantastic, 10/10, no notes.</p>

<p><strong>Gravity</strong> - VOY
6/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/5lL7IhQ.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We get a flashback of young Tuvok talking with a Vulcan master. Tuvok is a young Vulcan who does not want to give up his connection to emotions. “If we were born with emotions, why must we give them up? Where is the logic in that?” He seeks guidance, and the vulcan master is willing to help him learn to control his emotions.</p>

<p>Back in the present, an alien is scouring a desert world, finds a crashed shuttle, and finds Paris in there. She mugs Paris, stealing his stuff. For an ace pilot, Paris crashes a lot. She’s then attacked by some other aliens, who try and rob her. Tuvok comes and saves her, and manages to convince her he’s no threat. The translator is not working, so they cannot communicate with her. They can at least exchange names. Her name is Noss. She’s basically Tank Girl.</p>

<p>The Doctor is broken, but Paris is working on it. They go to her ship, Paris fixed the doctor, who thankfully has a working universal translator. She explains she’s been here for 13 seasons and many ships have come down, but no one’s been able to escape the planet.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/P20vv2M.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We have a time skip. Noss is learning some English, able to communicate barely. I guess this means Tuvok knows English. She befriends them, but especially Tuvok, she’s REAL into Tuvok. Oh no, this is going to be a Tuvok romance episode. For the record, Tuvok agrees, “oh no”. He has no interest. Paris tries to hook him up and he’s like “I am married?”</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/oGRqBNJ.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This is very funny out of context. Anyways Paris is being VERY weird. He claims he thinks Tuvok looks like he wishes he wasn’t Vulcan. Paris, what’s it to you buddy? We get more backstory about Tuvok being taught that Love is a dangerous emotion. Avoid it at all costs.</p>

<p>Back on Voyager, it’s been an hour since they lost sight of the shuttle. They’re scanning the dimensional sinkhole it fell into. Another alien ship is here to explain what it is, and that they will be closing it tomorrow so no one else is lost to it. So they need to try and save their crew as soon as they can.</p>

<p>Noss kisses Tuvok. He does not appreciate it. Oh boy. Paris is very annoying, but it now makes more sense when you realize that Paris has been stuck on a desert planet for like 5 months with a Vulcan. I’d be annoyed too.</p>

<p>The aliens are deciding to close the wormhole early. Why? No reason. They go “We’re going to do it now. Sorry”. I guess just to be fucking assholes, even though they know Voyager is trying to save their crewmates. I guess they can’t wait 2 fucking hours. The game is on, you understand.</p>

<p>They manage to get a message through for transport. There’s some struggle as, in just THAT moment, some aliens decide to attack them, but they make it through, all four of them.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/2gX6XcX.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They deliver Noss back to her home planet, but not before Tuvok mind melds with her to help her understand what he thinks and how he feels. She appreciates it, and they leave on good terms.</p>

<p><strong>Bliss</strong> - VOY
8/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/9cFUDwR.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We start with an alien we’ve never met yelling at nothing as his ship explodes and he flies into a weird distortion in space. “WHAT’S WRONG? CAN’T READ MY THOUGHTS?” as he flies towards it. He’s all leather and wood vibes, old creaky mother fucker. I love him and his ship.</p>

<p>Back on Voyager, they detect the wormhole. It leads DIRECTLY to Earth. Wow, convenient! They all agree, and plan to do scans. Meanwhile, Seven returns to Voyager from an outting, to find them all EXTREMELY excited about getting home. Seven is…. concerned. There’s some weird shit with this wormhole, but they’re like “oh it’s fine, we got messages from Starfleet through the wormhole!” Seven expresses concerns to Janeway, who’s like “ohhh you’re still just nervous about going to Earth. Don’t worry, it’ll be great!”</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/pXz9aKe.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>It’s all Smiley Smile cult energy, and it’s VERY uncomfy. Seven hacks Janeway’s personal logs to find that Janeway went from “This is clearly a trap” to “I set a course for the wormhole, we’ll be home soon” very VERY fast. Seven gets the Doctor in on trying to figure out what’s going on, and she finds scans of a vessel inside the wormhole. It’s the alien from the intro! He sadly goes “turn around. You’re being decieved. He Knows What You Want.”</p>

<p>WELL THAT’S CREEPY.</p>

<p>The message is cut off by Tuvok, who restricts access to Astrometrics. The Doctor is shut down, orders from Starfleet, cause the wormhole might damage him. They ALSO order Seven to be put in stasis, cause borg shenanigans. Yeah, I bet. Things are looking bad…. except for one thing. Naomi Wildman.</p>

<p>YES, SHE’S STILL HERE, AND RELEVANT! She’s confounded everyone is so creepy. She does NOT want to return to Earth either, so she appears to be immune. She and Seven try to stop this, but Seven is electrocuted at her station. They make it in. What appears to them as a wormhole appears to be a giant mouth that eats them.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/X2kVtjG.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We then get scenes of them experiencing JUST what they want to experience</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/YCutsdI.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Smash cut to them unconscious on the ground. Naomi walks through this all. Yeah this won’t be scarring for her psyche.</p>

<p>She wakes Seven up, and now it’s up to them, as the ship’s hull demolecularizes. That sounds bad.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/99rC5wG.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Seven Moms Naomi around. They need help, though. Seven contacts the alien inside, and transport him on board. He explains that this creature is a monster who telepathizes ships so that it can eat them. He’s been hunting it for 40 years, and THOGUHT he had finally found a way to kill it, but sadly it was yet another trick. They get the Doctor back up, and try to figure out a way to get the hell out of this thing. They determine a way: Using their seperate weapons, they can create a big noxious explosion that’ll give the monster a tummy ache. Cute.</p>

<p>They do, and it works! Oh wait no, it just wants Seven to think it works. She breaks the illusion with the others’ help, and then one more explosion gets them out.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/LB7bDFU.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We end with Voyager making its way off, Seven going “have the doctor explain, this was tiring and I’m going to bed”, while the alien who helped them makes his way back in. The hunt continues.</p>

<p>Good episode, I enjoyed it.</p>

<p><strong>Dark Frontier</strong> - VOY
7.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/20Urg4U.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We start with a Borg ship detecting Voyager and going to assimilate it. Voyager is like “Bad idea, leave us alone”. They do not, and are blown up. They were only meaning to disable them, but hit harder than expected. Janeway is feeling lucky today, so they decide to try and salvage the ship to get some Borg tech.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the trans warp coil is blown up. Buuuuuut, Seven detects another Borg ship on the horizon. Its weakened. You know what that means? It’s time to attack THEM and try to take a trans warp coil from them. Wow, that’s… ballsy. Seven is kinda cagey about the plan, but willing to help. They’re planning to use her parents’ notes on the attack, since they studied for Borg for years. They were studying the Borg for YEARS before most people even knew they were real. Seven is unhappy even thinking of her family, but Neelix makes her rethink her idea of just… ignoring thoughts on them.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/SD66JAe.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We get a flashback showing what happened to Seven’s family, and Humanity’s first real contact with the Borg. The Borg ignore them, but we know that won’t happen forever.</p>

<p>They do some testing on the Holodeck for their heist. It doesn’t go well. Everyone is anxious about the heist, ESPECIALLY Seven. Naomi comes to visit her, asking some question. A lot of questions. Too many questions. Then it gets worse as Naomi becomes a Borg in front of our eyes, and we find out Seven is being sent a message by the Borg.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/kPzn95A.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They let her know that the Borg knows that they know the plan, and that they WILL fail. But if Seven works with them, and goes back to them, they’ll leave Voyager alone. Why? Because Seven is unique.</p>

<p>Everyone on the crew can tell Seven is agitated, and Janeway takes her off the mission. She straight up BEGS Janeway to let her stay on the mission. Voyager is her collective, and she NEEDS them to survive. Please.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/xCLmOHo.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The heist happens. It goes, but Seven keeps being… distracted. She’s hearing voices in her head. Seven announces mid mission she’s staying, and forces them to leave without her. Janeway IMMEDIATELY tries to follow, but they warp away before they can try and rescue Seven.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ebhR6eX.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Hey look it’s the Borg Queen! Different actress, so lots of theories about this, but it’s the Borg Queen. She does her sexy sensual thing, and Seven is confounded, like “why the hell are you talking to me and not just taking me over”. I don’t get it either. I never understood, or liked, the Borg Queen. But I fucking hated First Contact so who knows. The Borg Queen claims she LET Seven go in the first place, to gain more information. That’s why they tried to assimilate Voyager all those times, I’m sure. She ALSO claims that Seven is the only Borg who ever returned to a state of individuality. So much for Hugh. And Locutus. And all those Borg on the planet Chakotay went to??? What the hell?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/O3VkTwB.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Most of the crew have given up on Seven. Torres is like “She was never one of us :)”. What the fuck Torres. But there’s one person who knows they need to save her. Naomi. God bless Naomi. Naomi is achieving EVERYTHING that Gene Roddenberry wanted with Wesley Crusher and failed at. She’s so good.</p>

<p>The Borg Queen explains that the reason they’re doing this to Seven, and won’t immediately convert her, is because they’re trying to learn what Humans are like, so they can actually succeed at taking over Earth next time. I kind of find this dumb I’m NGL. It’s better than First Contact, at least. This is a lot less “Yes Data, be horny for me” and more abusive mother, which is at least something.</p>

<p>Janeway finds out about the transmissions from the Queen, and also finds out where Seven is. She upgrades the Delta Flyers with Transwarp, and goes after Seven. She’s one of them now.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/9XWl8sq.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Back on the Borg Sphere, the Borg Queen enlists Seven to assimilate some aliens. She does, at first, but then sneaks some out. The entire scene is MASSIVLEY stressful. I keep comparing this to First Contact, but that was TRYING to go for the horror of the situation and it fell flat. This is doing it so much better even though this is a bunch of randos, and that was a bunch of Starfleet officers. Anyways the Borg Queen finds out about it and almost captures them, but then when Seven begs the Queen to let them go, she does. Huh. Maybe she’s having more of an effect on the Borg than they think she is.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/EYaoHkf.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Hey look, it’s Seven’s dad! Poor Seven.</p>

<p>Janeway and Tuvok beam onto the Queen’s vessel, both packing serious heat. Rick Berman must be on vacation again, they let Janeway carry a gun. She storms her way in to the Queen’s quarters, and has a stand off with her, before Paris beams them all out.</p>

<p>A Borg ship chases after them, but they make it back, Voyager blowing up Transwarp conduit behind them. Or so they thought. The conduit opens a gain, with LOTS of Borg signatures. Oh it’s just the ship they blew up that’s in a million pieces.</p>

<p>They use the transwarp coil and get 15 years closer to home, and far away. Seven is back home, where she belongs.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="Voyager" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Retro Achievement Mastery 169 - Shining the Holy Ark</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/04/17/RA169-HolyArk.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Retro Achievement Mastery 169 - Shining the Holy Ark" /><published>2025-04-17T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-04-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/04/17/RA169-HolyArk</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/04/17/RA169-HolyArk.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/413ne2g.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>This is one of my favorite games I’ve played this year so far. It’s not the best, it has too many flaws for that, but I had an absolute blast experiencing this for the first time, and I really loved it. This is Shining the Holy Ark, one of the last games in the Shining series before Sega rebooted it in 2002. Released exclusively on the Saturn in 1996, and never re-released anywhere, it is a spiritual sequel to the first Shining game, Shining in the Darkness. Not a tactics RPG like all the other games in the series, but instead a dungeon crawler.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/HnzFz9e.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>In Shining the Holy Ark you play as Arthur, a mercenary. He is accompanied by other mercenaries Melody and Forte, and is hired by the King of Enrich to hunt down and capture a ninja outlaw by the name of Rodi. The three of you follow Rodi to a nearby mine and, after a battle, are interrupted by a spaceship crashing into the fucking roof and killing all four of you. The spirits inside the ship are like “oh shit” and heal you all, but not before Forte is dragged away by an evil spirit. However, the side effect of this healing is that Rodi has lost his memories, and you all cannot step away from each other, or you’ll all die.</p>

<p>Then game then kinda meanders, as you’re like “well shit NOW what” and you try to find out what the hell is even going on, and uncover a plot years in the making to imbue the Vandals, an ancient lineage of powerful beings, with power and revive an ancient empire. Along the way you’ll get eight characters over all to join your party, and unlike other RPGs where this is almost a downside cause you don’t get to use everyone and have to throw new characters to the side, this game fixes that! But we’ll get into that soon.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/wRrebH7.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Holy Ark is a rather classic Blobber which does a lot to improve the formula and make it modern and enjoyable. Y’know, for 1996. When I played Shining in the Darkness, I was surprised that it felt so classic but with updated style. It was like, the perfect example of what a blobber should be. THIS, however, feels like the next evolution. You’re all on the same tile and you walk through dungeons, forests, mansions, even towns, one tile at at time. You run into enemies and do turn-based combat, typical RPG combat stuff. Usually that kind of combat is kinda mind numbing, and you end up turning your brain off and not focusing much on the game, BUT that’s where the first new inovation of this game comes into play!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/RxugPtH.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>As you progress, you can find “pixies”. They’re hidden throughout the world, sometimes in obvious spots like pots or in a weird dead end, but often times they’re VERY well hidden. All the more reason to explore. You have five kinds of pixies: Fairies, Pixies, Succubus, Incubus, and Leprechauns. When you get into combat, you’ll see the enemy move into frame from somewhere off screen. Depending on where that enemy is coming from, you can select your pixie and press the A button. Fairies hit things coming from the front, pixies above, succubi to the left, incubi to the right, and leprechauns when things are attacking from below you. They then attack and deal extra damage to the whole enemy group, and give you bonus gold and EXP. You can often tell what kind of enemy will come from where depending on the layout of the dungeon you’re in, so you can prepare ahead of time, but it’s a short window to swap fairies as something is attacking you.</p>

<p>This is a FANTASTIC system, IMO, and keeps you on your toes and focused as you explore, not just mindlessly moving forward and mashing A to do battles. No, you’re trying to get those fairy bonuses. Amazing system.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/oB7QpPX.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>The other improvement this game makes, IMO, is to its party system. Usually in a game like this, you swap party members out at towns, and can only use three to four at a time. But not here. You can, in fact, only use four at a time, but your party is always with you. Oh okay, so you swap them out inbetween battles then? That’s cool. Nope. You can swap them <strong>mid battle</strong>. EXP is shared with everyone, and if you decide suddenly you need your healers to come in and heal for this next battle turn, you can swap someone out for them. It makes for GREAT on the fly strategizing, and is absolutely freaking fantastic. This also works if someone dies, you can throw them in the back and replace them, so it’s not like “ugh god, gotta trudge back to town to revive”. Rodi, Arthur, and Melody actually CAN’T die btw. Cause they’re inhabited by holy spirits, they will revive to 1 HP after each battle. Everyone else has to be revived though.</p>

<p>Speaking of the different characters, I wanna talk about the art style. Obviously I love the 3D world, it’s so of its time in a way I like, but the character models are fantastic too. And you might recognize it. This is the art style that Camelot will stick to moving forward, as they exclusively work with Nintendo moving into the 2000s and make the Golden Sun games. This game feels like a bridge between Golden Sun and Shining Force, which is pretty neat. I personally prefer the art styles of Shining Force 1 and 2, but this is a good one too. Sadly, the one problem with the character designs in this game is the serious lack of non-humans. There’s one wolf man, and one dragon man, and that’s it. No centaurs, no weird deer-people, not even any elves or dwarves, nothing. You see some in towns, but not for your playable characters.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/rOMKBOI.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>All in all, this is probably the best dungeon crawler I’ve ever played. My main issue is the dungeon design isn’t SUPER interesting? It’s better than Shining in the Darkness, to be fair, but I dunno, I feel they could have done a bit more. Though a lot of the dungeons have unique gimmicks to them that helps.</p>

<p>Camelot would make one more game for this series, the terrifyingly long Shining Force 3, which I will hopefully tackle this year, before moving over to Nintendo, and the series would eventually be rebooted. There’s also Shining Wisdom which uh, I’ll have to get to sometime, too, though I am less excited for that.</p>

<p>Fantastic game, highly recommended.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Saturn" /><category term="SHining" /><category term="Obscure games" /><category term="RPGs" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is one of my favorite games I’ve played this year so far.

<p>I can promise you, by the end, this will be the longest written document about this game on the internet. I could explain the entire game in two sentences, but instead, I have a lot to say.</p>

<p>Yakyuuken Special is porn. You might look and go “wait a minute, what? Porn on the Saturn?” Yes. There’s actually like, 4-6 Saturn games that are porn. Notably, softcore porn. I don’t think penetration happens anywhere on the console, but there are some titties if you know where to look. This is one of those cases. Though, Yakyuuken is actually not originally from the Saturn. This is a port of a 3DO game, and it also got an unlicensed release on the PS1. All versions are essentially the same, except this has 4 more girls than the 3DO version, and the RNG is slightly different. I’ll get into it.</p>

<p>Why DID I play this game? Do I want to ogle 18 year old Japanese girls? Not particularly. See, on Retro Achievements, the site tracks who has the most masteries for each console. And I noticed I was close to the top for Saturn. So why not tackle some of the easier Saturn games and get a free mastery, right? That was the idea, and this game actually was in the “Free Points” hub, showing it was a piss easy game that would take you like 20-40 minutes, and give you free points, however few. By the time I’d be done playing this game, 8 months later, it would not have that label anymore, and it wasn’t by my hand. Someone else looked at it and went “oh god, no, we’re leading people into a trap”</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/03CUnBs.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Allow me to explain how this game works. The game starts up, and you press start to get past the title screen. Then you get a menu of 12 girls, A brings you in to the girl you want. Then you see the girl, there’s a bit of info, her age, her sizes, shit like that. Then a little FMV with her, and then it’s into the game proper.</p>

<p>Each battle, as it were, starts with the girl doing a goofy little jig. She swings her hips left and right, does a little spin, shakes her ass into the camera, spins back around, jumps, and throws her hand out. At this point, the FMV freezes and you must press A, B, or C. Each will send out either Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Then you get an animation of your hands clashing, and if you win, she loses health, and there’s an FMV cutscene of her stripping. More likely, though, is that you lose, and it jumps back to the ass jig. If you DO win, she strips and her ass jiggling is with a little less clothing on, until you take all five HP off of her.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/UM2725F.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>If you DO manage to do that, she will remove her last article of clothing, her panties. She will turn herself in a way where you can’t even really see the panties being removed, and then she’ll curl her leg over anything, so you in fact see LESS than when she had her panties ON. But then it freezes, so I guess you can jork it, and then you can press any button to go to another girl. It doesn’t track that you’ve won, and there’s no unlockables, but look at all 12 girls, and you’re done. You win, as it were. Easy peasy, right?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ZShdZWH.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>So I did not, in fact, play this game for 8 straight months. I played it on and off. But by the end, I was getting annoyed, and I developed a strategy. See, the game can play itself.</p>

<p>If you hold X and Z, it skips the ass jiggle cutscene, jumping you right to the RPS. This does not skip the stripping, but that’s okay. And if you hold A as well, it’ll just throw out rock over and over. But isn’t that bad? Won’t the game realize it, and stop you? Nope! See, the way RNG works in this game, is with every move you make, it determines whether you win, or lose. That’s it. That’s all it decides. Win, or lose. I won most of these matches by throwing rock over and over and over. It was straight up the real version of that fucking Simpsons meme. Good ol’ Rock. Nothing beats that.</p>

<p>Of course, the RNG is stacked against you, but that’s okay. We just need one more thing to make this game play itself. Put the start button on turbo, so it’s always pressing start, and you’re good. You can’t HOLD start to get past the title screen, but pressing it is fine. The game then keeps track of which girl you were playing, and with those three buttons held down, and start being pressed every few frames, you have the game playing itself. I put all of those buttons on one button, and put a fucking candle on my space bar, and went to bed. Game solved, right?</p>

<p>Nope. This worked for most of the girls, but then I got to my nemesis.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/rsu15KR.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>This is Rie Kouno. My villaness. Pretty sure she’s the oldest girl here, actually. She’s got this like, Japanese Housewife energy to her, as if 22 is 45 years old, cause this game is make by perverts with bad views on women. But anyway, my strategy did not work on her. I left the game playing, on double speed, for <strong>two days</strong>. And I did not win. By the end of the five days, I had assumed I had run through the entire RNG track, and it didn’t work. So I tried on Paper. Still nothing, two days later. Scissors? Nothing.</p>

<p>So, she beat me. I knuckled down and played the game legit for this one last girl, and yes, eventually I did it. She took her stupid panties off, and I won. I felt nothing.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/wnBP3sD.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>This expression will haunt me for the rest of my life. This is the face of a woman who knows you’re not getting any tonight. She’s seen the future and knows every single move you’ll make. Imagine being a horny Japanese pervert, tired after a long day of work, and you get home, ready to jork it to your favorite game, and this girl looks at you like this and goes “nuh uh, no tits for you” with that fucking smile on her face.</p>

<p>I think it’s safe to say I did not enjoy The Yakyuuken Special: Kon’ya wa 12-kaisen!!. It made me feel gross if I even considered using it for its original purpose, which I did not, even for a minute. It frankly fails in that purpose. It is not sexy. Most of these girls have the look of “god, this is my life now, huh?”, and call me a sex maniac, but I need a bit more than just the knowledge a girl took her panties off to jill myself. I’m not a Victorian getting the vapors from some fucking ankles. And it’s not like the actual GAME itself is fun. It’s rock paper scissors with really shitty, mean RNG. Over all, this took me like, 60 fucking hours. Just use pornhub, for however long that website will exist.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Saturn" /><category term="smut" /><category term="Obscure games" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I can promise you, by the end, this will be the longest written document about this game on the internet.

<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p><strong>Timeless</strong> - VOY
8/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/xRzFF0k.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We start with a pan on an icey world, which considering the quality of the video, makes it look like a 70s nature documentary. Two figures beam in, and announce “WE’RE HERE” as it zooms out to show Voyager under the ice. Very, very good setup.</p>

<p>They beam inside Voyager, and take off their masks to show that they’re Kim and Chakotay. They wander through the ship, trying to find things, as they walk past the long frozen corpses of Voyager’s crew. They find Seven’s corpse, teleport her to their ship, and activate the EMH, who’s like “What the FUCK is going on”, much like us. Chakotay says it clearly, without explaining anything, so it’ll be a good spot to go to break: “We’re here to change history”.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/1RQkGLc.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We get a flashback. They built a slipstream engine, and it LOOKS good. Everyone is celebrating, excited for the trip tomorrow. The engine’s designer, Paris, is the only one not celebrating. He’s running tests and diagnostics and finds a small slip up, which means they’ll PROBABLY all die. That’s bad. Harry though, uses his ingenuity to plan a way to fix it. He will use the delta flyer and basically tow Voyager to Earth. Now we know why Harry is alive. Chakotay goes with him. Now we know why CHAKOTAY is alive. Kim is VERY pushy that he can do this, he wants to get the fuck home.</p>

<p>Back in the future, 15 years in fact, they finish explaining it to the Doctor. And they’re here to use magic tech shit to send a temporal message back into the past. Future Harry is jaded as fuck, and looks great. He’s got a VERY small amount of gray in his hair, and his hair is in a new hair style. It helps make him seem like he’s much older. Meanwhile, Chakotay just put flour in his hair, and he doesn’t seem older, because he can’t act. Meanwhile they have a woman with them, Tess, who’s Chakotay’s girlfriend, who’s here to help them out.</p>

<p>They’re EXTREMELY wanted for stealing everything, and Federation ships are after them. So they’ve got very little time to break the Temporal Prime Directive. Tess and Chakotay have a moment in Voyager, while Kim work with the Doctor. Kim is jaded as fuuuuuck. He tells about how he got home, got honors and medals, and how he spent the entire time wishing he was dead in this ice rather than them. MASSIVE survivor’s guilt.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/HdgPHCc.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They get contacted by the ship here to take them home. Hey, look who it is! Geordi is an apologetic attacker here. He admits that if he was in their shoes, he’d probably be doing what they’re doing, but he has to protect his crew and the timestream, so he will stop them. They push their ship to stay away from Geordi, which ends in it starting to warp core breach, and Geordi’s like “Let me teleport you over, please”. Oh, Geordi.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/j58IyRt.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Kim sends a message back to Voyager with corrected telemetry, basically the correct message he was SUPPOSED to send. It doesn’t work. They’re still there. Kim freaks the FUCK out. He failed then, and he failed now. The Doctor basically slaps him to his senses, and he sends a message INSTEAD with incorrect telemetry that’ll drop them out of the slipstream immediately. He sends them JUST as they blow the fuck up.</p>

<p>It works, they’re all thrown out of the slipstream, nice and safe. Our episode ends with Kim watching a message from himself from the future.</p>

<p>This was a good episode. I was expecting more temporal angst about doing a thing they consider bad, but no. THey were pretty clear this was the correct thing for them.</p>

<p><strong>Infinite Regress</strong> - VOY
6/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/9bEMghw.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We get a weird cold open where Seven of Nine stalks around and hunts some meat, while in the mirror we see a Klingon devouring the meat. Is this an episode where Seven is possessed by Klingon Ghosts??</p>

<p>In the bridge meeting, Neelix laments that their late night bandit was back at it once again. Time to make locks. Locks, on a Starfleet vessel, my gosh.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/cRTDBHO.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Hey, Naomi is back! She’s following Seven around, observing her, because she wants to be perfect too, like her. Basically the writers saw that one scene with Naomi being scared of Seven, and thought it was a great idea to give them a continuous relationship thing. They were right. Anyways she suddenly SHIFTS, and is all happy and sweet and it’s extremely awkward to watch Seven SMILE. We see more people in mirrors and reflections, it’s VERY good.</p>

<p>She becomes a Klingon again, claims she’s Son of K’Vok, and tries to mate with Torres. It doesn’t go well. She knocks out a guard, and then becomes a scared little girl calling for help, because someone got hurt. Then she becomes a Vulcan ambassador, and then the Klingon again, before Tuvok knocks her out.</p>

<p>The Doctor basically diagnoses her with Borg Multiple Personality Disorder, as she’s displaying the memory engrams of people who she assimilated. They think the reason for it is a borg beacon from some debris near them, go they go and investigate.</p>

<p>Neli mentioned that this episode reminds her a lot of Masks, a late TNG episode with Data displaying multiple personalities. That episode was a chance to let Brent Spiner flex as an actor. This episode is doing the same exact thing. And it’s the exact same, an episode with a LOT of actor flexing.</p>

<p>One thing I like about this is Torres. Season 1 Torres, after being scratched by a Seven trying to fuck her? Would have been pissy about it for hours. This Torres? When Seven explains that the Klingon will not be with them, due to the dampener they have that’s supressing the personalities, Torres is like “Oh, so this isn’t our second date?” SHE JOKES ABOUT IT.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/TGdAnts.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They find out what the issue is. There was a recently assimilated group of people with a disease that spread through the link. Her neural pattern is not surviving this well, the Doctor almost loses her. And as one of the recently assimilated peoples arrives to explain it was a manufactured disease to try and hurt the Borg, they find there’s no treatment to the disease. But MAYBE Tuvok can mind meld to fix it, cause Vulcan mind meld magic.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/7EPOWQf.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Tuvok mind melds into a nightmare. There’s children screaming, very unpleasant, the effect is ugly and nauseating, meanwhile it keeps jumping back to Voyager where people are going “oh god shit’s fucked” as the alien of the week is attacking them to get the disease spreading thingy back, isntead of just waiting ten fucking minutes for them to be done with it. Anyways, I can’t even tell if the mind meld helped, it was just him getting thrown around for 3 minutes until they turned the fucking thing off, beamed it into space, and the episode ends.</p>

<p>All the acting from Seven was good. Everything else was meh.</p>

<p><strong>Nothing Human</strong> - VOY
3/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/7EPOWQf.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We start with the Doctor basically doing a Vacation Slides scene, and the quipping from everyone is SHOCKINGLY good. And then the fucking wave from Star Trek Generations comes and rocks the ship.</p>

<p>Afterwards, everyone is fine, but they get some kind of distress call that’s all screeching and alien sounding. I wonder how many aliens sound like that before the translator gets to them. They go to the call’s source, beam the nonhuman thing to sick bay, and then it jumps on Torres and the actress has to pretend that this fucking Zerg Body Pillow is attacking her, it is VERY funny.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/khredDd.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They need an expert on exobiology. The best one they can get from the holodeck is a Crell Moset, a Cardassian. He’s a VERY friendly guy, super pleasant and social. I can’t WAIT for this to become horrifying! All of the people on the ship are a little uncomfy. A lot of them ARE still Maquis, and they’re racist. Crell Moset gives a few signs into his nature. He laments that the Cardassians were ever on Bajor. He likes using scalpels, as it gives him more insight into the body of who he’s working on, more than laser cutters. He’s willing to kill this alien, which SEEMS to be sapient, if it means saving Torres.</p>

<p>The hologram destabalizes slightly, so they enlist the help of an Engineer. He’s a Bajoran Maquis member and ohhh we know where THIS is going, huh.</p>

<p>Anyways the REAL Moset did war crimes. Because of this, Torres refuses to let the hologram work on her, and half of the crew is angry about it. This Bajoran is going to resign his commission because of this. Y’all. It’s a hologram. And the personality engrams they made for this hologram are based on the known data on him that the Federation has, which does not include war crimes. Just make him look like a friendly Bolian, who GIVES a shit.</p>

<p>The Doctor holds the idiot ball, upset that people are trying to slander this guy cause of racism, though yes, he did war crimes. For the record though, Belanna IS racist. She directly admits, “guilty as charged when it comes to Cardassians, as far as I believe, they’re all scum”. And for some reason the hologram is like “YES I AM EVIL. WHO CARES, I’M HELPING SAVE PEOPLE.” so for some reason, yes, he has his “real personality”.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/UmyFzxY.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This is the dumbest shit in a while. There are a MILLION solutions to this problem. Here’s another one. Just use another fucking hologram. He can’t be the ONLY xenobiologist you have on file???? CHOOSE ANY OTHER ONE, WHO CARES.</p>

<p>Another alien ship shows up, and Frank Welker goes fucking ham. He’s the voice actor for the alien creatures, and he’s so squeely and awful that Janeway is like “can we turn that down, please”. They save Belanna’s life using Moset’s research, and the life of the alien, beam it to its friends, who leave happily, and then Janeway tells Torres to shut up about being angry they used his research on her. The Doctor then decides to delete Moset, deciding that he cannot in good conscience use research gained through suffering. The end.</p>

<p>I did not like this episode very much. They already did this episode better, without any of the easily fixed plot nonsense, with that episode with the doctor who saved Neelix’s life, after having killed most of his people in a nuclear blast. Anyways, meh.</p>

<p><strong>Thirty Days</strong> - VOY
7.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/FSPLUeC.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We start with Paris getting demoted. Seems they’re FINALLY done with his bullshit. Though again, he’s been way better lately. He’s demoted to Ensign. Damn, Paris got demoted before Kim got promoted, guess I lost the office poll. Janeway sentences him to 30 days in solitary confinement. Jesus, solitary  confinement in the 25th century? What the hell did he even do. He defiantly walks his way down to the brig and goes in.</p>

<p>While in there, he decides to write a letter to his dad. “Hey dad. You’ll never guess where I ended up!” yeah he probably can, Harry, this is not the first time. Anyways it’s just a framing device… for how it all went down.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/YjInB3I.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Voyager finds an ocean world. Not a world with an ocean in it, a planet made ENTIRELY of water, no land at all, being held by a containment field. Voyager is attacked by the people from the surface, but a quick explanation shows there’s no hostilities. The aliens there, the Moneans, offer to let Voyager scan their ocean, in exchange for them trying to help. The ocean is disappearing, and no one knows why. Paris IMMEDIATELY jumps at the opportunity. He LOVES the ocean, always has as a kid, and it fills him with a sense of wonder.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/5J00ZRb.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>As they explore below the surface, Voyager does its OWN scans and determines that the ocean will be gone within 5 years, so whatever they need to do they should do it fast. Down below, Paris and crew find the core, which is weakening. Why? Well, it turns out the ocean is getting denser, and it’s crushing the core, so its using more power to protect itself rather than keep up the containment field. But WHY is the ocean getting denser?</p>

<p>It’s pollution, basically. Industry and stuff is causing problems and it’s going to destroy the planet, the ocean, and the entire civilization if they don’t stop. Paris tries to convince them to, but “that would be giving up our ways of life! Never!” Ah. It’s one of THESE episodes. I think we’ll see how Paris got arrested soon. Paris yells at the consul about it, and Janeway snaps at him about it. She agrees with him, but they have the prime directive to worry about.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/pvS9e5r.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Tom makes a decision. If they can shut down the refineries, while they work on fixing them they can ALSO fix the pollution. Anything to save the ocean. So it’s time Tom becomes a fucking ecoterrorist. Yes. Now, I want to make it very, very clear. I am EXTREMELY pro-enviromentalism, and I have eco-terrorist sympathies, I will not lie. So I’m with Paris here. The episode wants you to be, mind you. The people he’s up against are stuffy beaurocrats who don’t want to lose profits. Who fucking cares?</p>

<p>Tom’s missile is intercepted in time before it blows up the refinery, and Tom is captured. Janeway admires his principles, and understands why he did what he did, but this IS a ship and they need people to follow orders. So he’s demoted, and given 30 days of solitary confinement. Though, of note, throughout the episode we saw that Janeway let multiple people visit him.</p>

<p>This letter he’s writing is to show that yes, he went to jail. But this time, he did it for a good cause, and something he believed in. I liked this episode.</p>

<p><strong>Counterpoint</strong> - VOY
2/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/dgkwlg0.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Voyager is being boarded by a Devore inspection team. Apparently this is routine. They beam on board, and one beams directly into Janeway’s office, takes command of the ship, and tells her to come to her office and “make herself at home”.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/dgkwlg0.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>If this shit was any more Nazi coded it would be an Enigma Machine. He plays some classical music over the intercom while his people go around inspecting the ship. He’s the overly friendly nazi type, offering her coffee as his people walk around and are dickheads, breaking shit on purpose as the Doctor is like “Please, thats fragile-“</p>

<p>The lead nazi is like “You need friends here. I can be that friend~” while still being a y’know, nazi. They do not find what they’re looking for and leave, though. What they’re looking for is telepaths. Luckily for them, the two Vulcans on board died a while ago in an accident, so they have no telepaths at all</p>

<p>No obviously that’s not true. They’re just holding them in the teleporter buffer. And not JUST the Vulcans; other refugees too! Yes. This is an episode about hiding the jews from the nazis. Just, fucking straight up. It’s not hiding it. Their plan is to send the refugees through a wormhole that’ll take them out of this space.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/cFVNlK2.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The inspector, Kashyk, shows up again, alone, and explains that actually, fascism is bad. And all that shit he JUST told her 8 minutes ago about how telepaths cannot be trusted? He doesn’t believe it anymore. He wants to help the refugees, which he knows they’re harboring, and warns them that they’re about to go into a trap, which they find out is true. No one trusts him, understandably. But there are plenty of sympathizers in his people, so the refugees are like “He could absolutely be telling the truth”. But you never know.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ev6zlQT.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Janeway straight up tells him she does not trust him, but he’ll be kept on the ship, cause they can’t just give him up if he’s asking for asylum. But he’s under CONSTANT surveillance, and they don’t trust him. He understands. Anyways from that point on he’s in all major meetings, on the bridge as they’re doing stuff, and giving advice. Why is he here? Why is she letting him do this?? They have a cute scene together that’s clearly romantic. Please do not do this.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/bghR7XP.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>For some reason, now everyone trusts him. I have no idea why. There was no real thing where he risked his life to save anyone, or anything. He DOES declare that he’s going to sacrifice himself to save them, though. He’ll take his ship and go back to the Devore, taking command of their inspection team, and in the confusion, letting Voyager pass. Okay, it has to be a trick, right? Like, they tearfully let him go, he kisses Janeway before leaving, but they have to be setting a trap. And yes, Janeway’s expression as he leaves makes that clear.</p>

<p>Anyways another inspection happens, and this fucker is back in his post as the head inspector, doing his shtick he did the first time around. Yep, he betrayed them! What a fucking surprise! But whoops, Janeway tricked him and never ACTUALLY trusted him! He decides to let them go so that this isn’t on his permanent record, and because some of those feelings were real! She’s sad he did this, but it is what it is.</p>

<p>Wow! This episode kinda blew! So, if this episode was JUST Janeway Bugs Bunnying a nazi, I would have liked it. That would have been good. But no, the intention, and how you’re supposed to read it, is that she DID develop feelings for him, and was genuinely hoping he’d go with them. The design concept for this was “it’s been a while since Janeway had a romance partner!” YEAH, BUT WHY <strong><em>THIS</em></strong> ONE?!</p>

<p>God almighty, it’s such an absolute BLUNDER of a concept that was actually quite good! Janeway bugs bunny’s some nazis. That’s good, let’s run with it. NO. DO NOT HAVE HER FALL IN LOVE WITH CHRISTOPHER WALTZ’S CHARACTER FROM INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?! It was also OBVIOUS what was happening from the very start. As soon as that guy showed up and said “I am requesting asylum”, I knew beat for beat how the entire rest of the episode was going to go, and it did not surprise me, in any way.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="Voyager" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Retro Achievement Mastery 167 - Shining Force Gaiden II - The Sword of Hajya</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/04/10/RA167-SFGHajya.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Retro Achievement Mastery 167 - Shining Force Gaiden II - The Sword of Hajya" /><published>2025-04-10T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-04-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/04/10/RA167-SFGHajya</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/04/10/RA167-SFGHajya.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/gHBQFxH.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>So, Shining Force Gaiden 1 came out, though only in Japan. It was its own concise little story, but before Shining Force II could come out, half a year after the first Gaiden game and only a year after the first Shining Force game, Shining Force Gaiden II came out. It’s a continuation of Gaiden 1, which was technically a sequel and continuation to Shining Force, though the two games are now VERY seperated.</p>

<p>See, Gaiden 1 is about a kingdom, Cypress, that was taken over by an evil demon worshipper. The true king was killed, and the prince fled. Prince Nick is your player character, who seeks help from the forces of Guardiana, the setting of the first game. So you get help from them while also building your own forces from rebels and other people in your shattered kingdom.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/SFUviZ7.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>At the end, you win, and are reinstated. Like, duh. Spoilers, I guess. In this game, you are playing as soldiers of THAT restored kingdom. Guardiana IS mentioned, as they’re allies. But you only see a single character from Guardiana, and that’s late game, who shows up triumphantly to help you. Most of the time you’re using either new characters, or returning units that Nick found along the way in Gaiden 1.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ObY1S58.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>You are NOT play as Nick though. Nick’s gone off to war with the evil Iom and gotten captured! Instead, you’re playing as… well, that’s difficult. This is the only Shining game with duo protagonists. Your main character, Deanna, is NOT the leader of the Shining Force in this game. Instead, that’s Natasha. Both of you have Egress, and neither get a lot of dialogue or characterization, but Natasha is technically the actual leader, NOT Deanna. Deanna is just a soldier. One who has plot relevence to what’s going on, but just a soldier. This means Natasha is the ONLY female lead in the entire series…. and of course, she’s relegated to co-lead. A shame.</p>

<p>Anyways you may remember that Gaiden 1 did not come out in the US. This one did! So this story was probably VERY confusing to those who played Shining Force and then wanted to play this!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/A0upWQg.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Other than the story, it’s really just more Shining Force Gaiden. Same exact engine and everything. The only gameplay difference is that this one is way, way harder for some god forsaken reason. The reason is very clear, though: There’s a bug. The numbers for damage for level 3 spells are accidentally too high. So late game, when there’s two to three units who can use Frost 3, you BETTER chase them down and blow them up before they can move, because Frost 3 has a very wide space, and it WILL do 50 damage per attack, wiping out entire armies who are max health.</p>

<p>Other than THAT, which was very annoying, it’s an enjoyable game. If you liked Gaiden 1, it’s still worth your time. Though MAYBE just play Shining Force CD.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Game Gear" /><category term="Shining" /><category term="Obscure games" /><category term="RPGs" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, Shining Force Gaiden 1 came out, though only in Japan.
