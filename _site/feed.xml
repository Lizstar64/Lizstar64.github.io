<p>Alright, this is much more my speed than the previous two Apple games. This is Pooyan, a very classic arcade game by Konami from the early 80s. We’ve actually got quite a few arcade ports on the Apple II. Name a game from that era, they prolly tried to make a port of it. Keyword being try.</p>

<p>Most arcade ports to the Apple II do NOT work, in my opinion. The hardware is just so limited that movement and control is stilted, awkward, and stiff. For fast paced action games, it feels AWFUL. I’m talkin’ things like Dig Dug, Mario Bros, Pac-Man, even arcade inspired games that require fast twitch movement, absolutely horrendous. But Pooyah is prolly the best of these I’ve played.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/54q1IM0.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>In Pooyan, you play as a mama pig trying to protect her kids from a straight up horde of hungry wolves. They come equipped with balloons, and are trying to get down to the bottom, or up to the top of a tree, depending on the round. You move up and down on an elevator, and are trying to shoot them down with a bow and arrow. Occasionally you can grab some meat, which allows your shots to kill instantly and pierce. You need to hit the wolve’s balloons, and not them, so it takes some tricky precise aiming, though you get plenty of chances, cause they need like 4 or more wolves to get through to win, and you can usually spam a bit.</p>

<p>The thing that makes Pooyan on Apple II better than its contemporaries is that you’re really only controlling up and down. It gets stuck and awkward sometimes, but it’s SO much better than anything else I’ve tried to play. And again, you can spam a lot, which helps. To get FAR and survive, you need to be precise, but you can get by with a little luck and spam.</p>

<p>In the arcades, Pooyan is a tricky but great forgotten gem. Here, it’s just a pretty okay port. I’d certainly NOT recommend this version, but it’s doing its best, and I respect it for that.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Apple" /><category term="Obscure games" /><category term="Pooyan" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alright, this is much more my speed than the previous two Apple games.

<p>Mind Castle is a 1984 text adventure by MCE where you’re exploring an abandoned mansion, which is said to contain treasures. As you enter, you are accosted by some kind of spirit that challenges you to a game. Solve his puzzles, and you can reach the top of the mansion and gain the treasure.</p>

<p>Along the way, you’ll explore the rooms in typical text adventure fashion, typing east, west, etc. Every room you enter has a new puzzle, usually based on that room you’re in, and you can ask for that room’s puzzle. Your host then gives you a puzzle, and it’s usually logic puzzles. And its USUALLY logic puzzles that are trying to troll you.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/iFqUKLE.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Here’s an example. This puzzle says a Zebra is on its way to the river, and sees a bunch of other animals. How many animals in all were going to the river? Well, one. There’s a LOT of puzzles like that. Over all, the puzzles are trolly, but not bad. There were a few that stumped me, but not for too long. This IS a kid’s game, after all. There’s also nothing here that’ll make you scratch your head for hours. In terms of Text Adventures, this is one of the easiest. There’s no like, over arching puzzles, everything is held to each room, and you just need to solve all the puzzles to climb the stairs to the next floor.</p>

<p>While this game won’t sit with me forever, for what it is, it’s quite enjoyable. I also love the ugly Apple II art, as I always do. Look at that fucking Giraffe.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Apple" /><category term="Obscure games" /><category term="Mind Castle" /><category term="Text Adventures" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mind Castle is a 1984 text adventure by MCE where you’re exploring an abandoned mansion, which is said to contain treasures.

<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p><strong>The Disease</strong> - VOY
3.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/XqpFEBS.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Our episode starts with Kim getting laid. Considering this episode is called The Disease and we see Kim getting laid with some alien, I’m real worried. Is this going to be the STD episode? On today’s Very Special episode, Janeway teaches Kim what a condom is.</p>

<p>Anyways it turns out the aliens of the week are some people Voyager are working with. They’re helping fix and improve their engines, in exchange for information and knowledge. These aliens are xenophobic and have been on this generational ship for… well, generations. They’ve been mistreated by aliens here, so try to avoid contact, but Voyager is xenophilic, and you know how extroverts are with introverts. This ALSO means that Kim fucking one of them is massively not allowed. It’s ALSO unfortunate for Kim because he is so, so, SO bad at lying.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/JPhhemN.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This gets out of hand when he’s showing some signs of a medical issue. He has to admit that he did, in fact, have sex with that woman. The Doctor is like “I’m sorry, I have to alert the captain about this”, who is livid. Apparently, it’s a rule that “before having sexual relations with any alien species, you need permission from your captain and medical officer”. This is nuts. Literally, but also this is wild. Are you telling me Riker got permission from Dr. Crusher all the time about fucking all those aliens he absolutely fucked? Or Kirk going to Bones like “Hey I’mma get some green pussy you okay with that”? Maybe they mean like, unknown aliens? Which y’know, fair, but also it feels so weird and gross you’d need permission for that, I dunno. Anyways, Kim gets reprimanded. Is THIS the reason he never gets a promotion? Cause he had sex once?</p>

<p>I do like how Janeway almost literally goes “I get why you did it, she’s really hot”. Not jumping the allegations there, Janeway. She’s being really harsh and bad about this though, and Chakotay asks her about why, and she’s like “He’s just an ensign, he hasn’t earned the right to try and push against my rules”. DUDE. HE’S YOUR OPS OFFICER. HE’S A SENIOR OFFICER.</p>

<p>There’s also talk of a disease that happens when people fuck. It fades as you stay away from them, but the more you’re with them, the more it grows. It’s love, they’re talking about love. That’s cheesy.</p>

<p>Also also, there’s some stuff about sabotage, some parasites that are causing hull fractured, caused by a faction on the alien ship that wants to break away from the authoritarian regime in control.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/nalZXHm.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Kim and this girl, Tal, are actually kinda cute together? But obviously it’s not to be. They have different values, and those values come to a head when Tal is called in for questioning. They believe she’s in charge of setting up these parasites, and she comes clean. The parasites will cause the ship to break apart and become multiple ships. Dunno how THAT works but okay. Janeway also gets REALLY pissy about Kim disobeying orders, mostly out of a pissy “NO I’M IN CHARGE” kinda energy that I hate and don’t agree with, but I’m not exactly military now am I?</p>

<p>Voyager ends up almost risking its life to protect the Varro ship, and the dissidents go their seperate ways. Instead of trying to solve the virus problem they just don’t. Well that was easily solved. I guess. Janeway even lets Kim see his girlfriend one last time. Damn, aren’t you lucky that mom is letting you out of your grounding, Kim? Even after this, the episode goes on for like 7 more minutes because they really needed to drive home the fact that love bites, love bleeds, it’s bringin’ me to my knees.</p>

<p>This episode was mostly boring and annoying to me.</p>

<p><strong>Course: Oblivion</strong> - VOY
8/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/llxSAjT.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We start with Torres and Paris getting married! That might seem kinda sudden, and everyone agrees. Seven of Nine outright says she expected homicide before marriage, but hey, it works. It’s a cute scene. Also huh, Paris is lieutenant again! That’s interesting. I guess they just forgot to mention him getting re-promoted :). Everyone throws rice at them as they leave the room, which then sinks through the floor as it distorts and falls and bounces through the ship. That’s weird.</p>

<p>Everyone is going well on the ship! They’ve developed some new engine which shows that they’ll make it home in only two years. That’s great, what good news. Torres and Paris are going to go on honeymoon, which leaves Seven to be in charge of the new warp drive.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/BtG8a04.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Seven confirmed for polyamory. Also, based based based.</p>

<p>They find that weird wibbly wobblyness in the jerrytube from the start. Turns out it’s some molecular unstableness from the warp drive, but even after they shut it down, it’s still happening. And then it hits the crew as well.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/xGCgFG6.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They have a theory. Anything brought on board the ship within the past few weeks is not deteriorating, so it was something that happened to the ship within the past few months. They go back through their data logs to try and find out wtf the cause could be, citing a bunch of episodes we never saw. Of all the ones they go through though, there is one that we’ve seen. The episode with the Silver Blood.</p>

<p>Torres ends up dying. Paris does NOT take it well. Wow I can’t believe they killed off Torres. No, obviously. Chokie and Tuvok burst in and explain. They are not actually Voyager, they’re all copies. And something is causing them to disintigrate. Possibly the core, no one knows.</p>

<p>Janeway announces to the crew they’re all copies, but tells them that what matters if who they ARE, not where they ACTUALLY came from. Their memories, they’re thoughts, their beliefs. And they have an important goal that they have to stick to. Getting home. It’s causing the crew to fracture a bit. Paris is like “none of this is real or matters so it’s fine”, becoming kind of dead to the world. Chakotay BEGS Janeway to go home. Not to Earth, but to THEIR home, the Hell Planet. They find a nearby class Y hell planet, hoping that it’ll be enough. Unfortunately, that planet has some mining treaty which doesn’t allow people to go on it, so they open fire. They COULD blow up these people and kill them, but despite everything, they’re still Starfleet. They won’t kill people over a misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Chakotay dies, and Janeway hits a bit of a despair wall. They have no other choice. They bring the warp drive back online, and head back to the Demon Planet.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/CN7FvC9.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We get a bit of a time jump. We’re in Lather That Shit On Me mode. Most of the senior crew has died. Neelix is now senior medical officer. “Morale is a luxury”. Janeway announces that they should make a time capsule, because they might not be able to survive, but none of them, or what they did, should be forgotten. Unfortunately, Janeway dies shortly afterwards. Things are not looking good.</p>

<p>KIM FINALLY GETS A PROMOTION. GOOP KIM IS CAPTAIN FOR A FEW DAYS. CONGRATS TO GOOP KIM. Kim can LITERALLY only get promoted if every other person dies first.</p>

<p>Neli described this episode as “like year of hell for for goo”. The Year of Gell.</p>

<p>The time capsule they make gets destroyed because of malfunctioning controls. But they have ONE last hope. They see a ship nearby. They have to drop out of warp and try to get its help. Unfortunately, ejecting the warp core causes the ship to tear itself apart, and everyone dies. No time capsule, nothing. Their history, everything they were, everything they did, forgotten. Might as well not have happened.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/a32R54G.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Meanwhile on Voyager, they’re chasing after a distress call. They arrive at the last known coordinates and find a bunch of weird debris floating through space. Cause unknown, no survivors. They make a small note in the ships log and move on.</p>

<p>This feels less Star Trek and more Twilight Zone tbh. It was very entertaining, at least!</p>

<p><strong>The Fight</strong> - VOY
4/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/QbCO2z4.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We start with Chokie thrashing about in med bay screaming about voices in their head. Apparently he’s “ambassador” for some aliens they’re trying to contact? Torres says they’re in “chaotic space” but they’ll be in danger if they stay in it for much longer. Fascinating. The Doctor explains a bit better after the cold open. They are stuck in this space, and they need to get out. Chakotay is their only chance of getting out, communicating with the aliens who live here.</p>

<p>We get a jump back in time. Chokie was in a holodeck simulation, with Boothby as his guide through a boxing match. Boothy explains that boxing is not about trying to fight the other person, it’s about fighting the human urge to not get hurt. Interesting. Anyways Chokie sees a weird-ass fractal nightmare behind his opponent and gets the daylights knocked out of him. He explains this as the doctor sutures him up and makes fun of boxing as a concept, and then they get dragged into a weird ass goopy space nightmare.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/PP2URcc.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Seven explains they are in Chaotic Space. It’s a very dangerous space that jumps in and out of existence. Only one Borg Sphere has ever survived its encounter with Chaotic Space, which isn’t good odds. As they explore and try to find a way out, Chakotay starts hearing voices. They’re all based on boxing. After being sent to medbay, they find out Chakotay has a family gene that causes hallucination and insanity. He has the gene suppressed after his granddad went mad. Apparently Fluidic space might be causing it to come back.</p>

<p>Chakotay’s plan is to go into a vision quest. God fucking dammit can they not think of things to do with Chakotay other than getting him laid, or getting him to go on a vision quest???</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/4mFetKa.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Akoo-chee-moya, we are far from the bullshit of our fake native advisor. Oh wait no, We’re very close to it.</p>

<p>We get a lot of nonsensical fuzzy scene that are really hard to focus on or follow, because it’s SUPPOSED to be like that, where Chakotay is a pugilist running around Voyager, with Voyager stuff mixed up with pugilism. There’s also lots of stuff about his grandfather, talking about “them”, about how they’re so loud and talkative, but not so bad once you get used to them.</p>

<p>Eventually the Doctor drags him out of the hallucination, but he’s still like, half stuck in it. He claims that he needs to go back in the ring, he can “take them”, but also “Captain, when have we strayed away from first  contact”, “they’re about to ring the bell, I need to be there to meet the people who live here”. Kinda interesting. Janeway lets him go back into the hallucination fully.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/TRRDXgq.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>He communicates with the aliens, who communicate through what I can only describe as “the prophets, but they communicate using clips of previous Voyager characters talking”. Chakotay is afraid to fully commit to communication, because they need to realign his mind and he’s afraid of losing himself completely to insanity, but he does to save the others. As the doctor says, even if he does go, he’ll be with friends. Which y’know, sacrifice for friends kinda thing. The aliens tell him out to get out, and he rushes to the bridge and gets them out of chaotic space just before they start to fall apart. The episode ends with Chakotay totally fine, and going back in to the holodeck for more boxing.</p>

<p>Eh. Parts of it were interesting I guess, but I kinda feel like I’m gonna forget this episode after tonight, and it kinda didn’t finish itself properly.</p>

<p><strong>Think Tank</strong> - VOY
7.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ZgmEBu7.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We start with an alien coming aboard a ship to meet a “Kurros”. Then George Costanza comes out and explains how happy he was that they could help. Apparently this guy’s planet was suffering debilitaing earthquakes. Unfortunately, the last quakes caused their payment to be buried under tons of rock…. or was it? George already accounted for this, and knows that they actually are hiding the payment. This alien’s people needs it for their replicators, to keep them fed, but if Costanza doesn’t get paid, he’ll just blow up their planet, causing the quakes to start again :) Hey, it’s only fair, they DID offer to pay him it in the first place! Oh, George.</p>

<p>Back on Voyager, Janeway is playing with what is essentially a Space Rubix Cube. She’s called out as they go to mine a planet of some minerals they need. As they approach, however, the planet fucking explodes, covering them in an explosive gas cloud as a Hazari ship comes to meet them. Seven explains what the Hazari are: They are basically bounty hunters with a work ethic. They were hired to get Voyager, and that’s what they’re going to do. Voyager barely escapes, but the Hazari are good at this. They’ve laid other traps. How do they know what is an escape route, and what’s a trap? Good thing GEORGE COSTANZA IS HERE TO HELP!</p>

<p>George uses a projection to put himself in Janeway’s room, and explains who he is. He’s Korros (I’mma keep calling him George), of a small group of aliens who study problems and help people solve them. Janeway calls them a Think Tank, which George likes. He offers to help them escape the Hazari. Okay, calling it now, George Costanza hired the Hazari. He’s making problems for people so that they’ll hire him to solve them. Which, tbh, is a VERY George Costanza thing to do. Very accurate.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/m38JFUV.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Holy SHIT Seven and Janeway are going on an aquarium date. This too is Yuri.</p>

<p>They meet all the members of the Think Tank, who SEEM pleasant enough. They HAVE done stuff with wars and stuff, but mostly they just try to help people, do not create weapons of mass destruction, and do not decimate populations. They find things for people, solve ecological problems, stuff like that. They RECENTLY cured the Vidiians of the Phage! Remember the Vidiians? You’d hardly recognize them now! Not that they will ever be seen again.</p>

<p>They give Janeway their price for helping them out. A recipe for soup, information on slipstream, an Olmec statue Chakotay owns (of COURSE he’s the one who own it), aaaaand also Seven of Nine. Ah.</p>

<p>So, not like, as a slave or something. They’re not BARTERING for Seven. They appreciate her and want her to join them as a member of the Think Tank. And Janeway is clearly disturbed by the idea, but it’s ultimately Seven’s idea, and she won’t stop her. Seven considers it. She wants to know more.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/QTmX26Y.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>But quickly decides she doesn’t really appreciate the way they live their life. Seven is like “How many people have suffered because they could not pay you?” Damn, Seven, I’d think you’d think that irrelevant, but you’ve got some good ethics on you. She rejects their offer, and George Costanza has some… unhappy energy about this. After another attack by the Hazari, they capture some and scan their computers to find who hired them. It was a Malon! But that makes no sense, the Malon are capitalists, there’s no profit in revenge. So they do some digging and yeah, it’s George.</p>

<p>Now the Hazari and Voyager have a common enemy. The Think Tank are infamous, and have a lot of enemies who’d want to capture them for a good bounty. There’s a good scene where try to outthink the think tank and it doesn’t work. Janeway is still fiddling with the Rubix Cube, and then gets sick of it and gives it to Seven. She solves it instantly. How? She scanned it. “That’s cheating!” “Cheating is efficient.”</p>

<p>THey learn from that. It’s time to cheat.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/KI6Q2Cx.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The Think Tank finds the Hazari attacking Voyager, who announces that they have Voyager but are upping the bounty 3x. George agrees to pay, and then Seven escapes Voyager to get to the Think Tank and offer herself to save Voyager. THey get her, but suspect a trap, so connect her to their telepathy thing to read her mind and determine Janeway’s plan. Aaaand the trap is sprung. They send a wave through the telepathy thing, disrupting it, and making it so none of the Think Tank can communicate with each other. The Hazari attack, Seven beams out, and Janeway gets in one last sass at the Think Tank before they leave them behind to their fate. Damn, cold.</p>

<p>This was an enjoyable one. Not great, just good.</p>

<p><em>**</em> - VOY
6/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/DSbHIfN.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Our episode starts with a Malon ship having some problems. Their tanks are rupturing, and they need to eject them. The system they’re in is inhabited, but they have no choice. They send some people down to the tanks to try and force the ejection, sending them to die. Ahhh, it’s VERY Druuj.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tuvok has been assigned to teach Belanna how to meditate. I dunno if that’s a good way to go about this??? I dunno if that’s even POSSIBLE? Also, they’ve written her so well recently. Now they’re intentionally writing her worse again, like she’s had no character progression, to make a point in this episode. It’s Flanderization, they’re Flanderizing her.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/YF9iiaL.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They find the Malon freighter, and the escape pods. Only two Malon have survived. They’re the most pleasant Malon we’ve ever met, but they don’t really want to go back, they’re ready to leave at any moment.Not that they really have anywhere to go, the ship is going to explode soon, and they can’t get away fast enough, apparently. Dunno how THAT works but sure. So they need to go onto the freighter and shut it down from inside. We’ve got our team. It’s Neelix, Belanna, and Chokey, and the two Malon, Fesek the leader, and Pelk, a young crewmember.</p>

<p>We learn more about the Malon. Fesek is a sculptor half the year. The other half he transports waste that will probably half his life span, and why? To keep his planet safe and tidy, to rid it of toxic waste. Sure that toxic waste goes elsewhere, but he does EVERYTHING he can to keep it safe, and make sure it gets to unpopulated areas. It’s just, y’know, things go wrong. Like this time. Torres thinks it’s disgusting. Yeah, I mean, we know they COULD clean it up and go green, but that removes profit.</p>

<p>Pelk is attacked by something. There are rumors of Theta wave creatures who live in the radiation. Pelk dies as he rambles about monsters. Hallucinations ARE a side effect of theta radiation. Was it real… or fake???</p>

<p>This episode is kinda cool and good, except for Belanna being overly belligerent to try and get her towards character development she’s already been through. She’s dying from theta radiation and is like “I REFUSE TREATMENT RAWR BRAGA BRAGA”</p>

<p>They detect an alien lifeform that’s cloaked by theta radiation, and detect its near them, and trying to stop them at every opportunity. It almost kills Chakotay, who’s beamed away safe, but hurt.</p>

<p>There’s a big fight in foggy smoke. It’s kinda hard to see anything. Belanna is sweaty, damaged, and hot in her tank top. She rips a pipe out and fight this guy in the smoke. He’s a horribly irratidated Malon. He was irradiated and left for dead, and now wants to kill everyone and hurt them for what they did to him. Destroy EVERYTHING, even innocents. So now Belanna has to talk him down, bringing it back to uh, her having a temper. I don’t think it’s super well handled. She fights him back when that fails, and they drive the thing into the sun.</p>

<p>Fesek is probably going to die young, due to his radiation poisoning. Occupational hazard. Everyone else gets out fine. We end with Belanna naked and sexy in a sonic shower as she has PTSD flashbacks of her attacking the irradiated guy.</p>

<p>I liked all the actiony stuff and solving the problem of the week, but it lost it trying to do a moral, and trying to give it a point. It’s okay if it’s not teaching anything and is just about solving a problem.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="Voyager" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Retro Achievement Mastery 171 - Frog Jump - Ordering Numbers</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/04/24/RA171-Frog.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Retro Achievement Mastery 171 - Frog Jump - Ordering Numbers" /><published>2025-04-24T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-04-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/04/24/RA171-Frog</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/04/24/RA171-Frog.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/E5StrMJ.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>If I thought the last game was a failure as education AND entertainment, this goes beyond that.</p>

<p>This is a game made by like one dude and published by Mindscape in 1985. It is MASSIVELY simple. You choose a difficulty, and then one or two players. Then, the game gives you a simple math problem. Depending on how fast you answer it, you hop around a board. Whoever reaches the end first wins.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/AHr5BPh.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Even for a game for kindergarteners learning basic addition, I just don’t think there’s anything here. The colors and art are drab, the sounds are not good, the concept is boring and uninteresting. I’m sorry, this is one of the least games I’ve reviewed so far. It sure did count towards the event I’m doing on RA, though!</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Apple" /><category term="Obscure games" /><category term="Edutainment" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[If I thought the last game was a failure as education AND entertainment, this goes beyond that.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Retro Achievement Mastery 170 - Investigating Plant Growth</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/04/24/RA170-PlantGrowth.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Retro Achievement Mastery 170 - Investigating Plant Growth" /><published>2025-04-24T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-04-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/04/24/RA170-PlantGrowth</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/04/24/RA170-PlantGrowth.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/MHxvJlQ.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>It’s time for a bunch of Apple II games! Every three months RA chooses a console to make a bunch of sets for, and then you can do those sets for points towards an event. So expect a bunch of Apple II games for a bit. The thing about Apple II games is that a lot of them are edutainment, and a lot of them are short and don’t have much to them. This is both of those things.</p>

<p>This is a game by someone you’ve never heard of, John Boeschen, and published by a company you’ve never heard of, Silver, Burdett, &amp; Ginn Inc. There’s a lot of these on Apple II. This game is very simple. You take the role of a biologist on the space station, and you need to find the correct growing conditions for food so you can feed people on the station.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/LNFDVmD.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>You can study the different plants and processes, reading about what photosynthesis is and whatnot, but this is basically not helpful. You can also practice growing plants, choosing their level of water, sunlight, and heat. You can give each of these in units up to 3. Obstensively you’re supposed to read the descriptions of each of the crops you’re trying to grow to determine what needs less water/heat, but I found that it feels kinda random, even with what the notes say about how much heat beans need or whatever. But if you find the perfect 100% growing conditions, then they’re that forever. You just need to find the correct conditions and write down notes of them.</p>

<p>After that, you have the text mode, where it’ll ask you to get a specific amount of food grown from three random crops, maybe with a challenge condition, like you have less units to work with than usual. And that’s just putting in the numbers you recorded earlier. Sometimes it’s impossible to get a perfect score, but don’t worry, if you don’t want to do a specific challenge, you can ask Houston to give you another! Wow how helpful.</p>

<p>Obviously, I don’t think this has much educational value, and barely any gameplay or entertainment value either. It’s interesting as a historical curiosity though. A look into what education was like in 1987. It wasn’t much better than it is now, frankly.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Apple" /><category term="Obscure games" /><category term="Edutainment" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s time for a bunch of Apple II games!

<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p><strong>Latent Image</strong> - VOY
7.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/JgcTc5k.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The Doctor is taking holo images of everyone, which he can use for medical research. He gives an example to Kim about this, showing that he can look at Kim’s spine without having to like, slice him apart, using the holo imager. As they examine his spine, the Doctor notices a weird incision that’s the sign of a neural surgery, and with a technique he developed himself. Neither he, nor Kim, remember this surgery. Uh oh.</p>

<p>The doctor talks to Janeway about it, who’s been avoiding the doctor, seemingly just cause she doesn’t like any medical stuff. She’s like “weird, I’ll schedule a scan for you but we’re a bit busy now.”. Then he goes to Seven of Nine, asking for her help. She agrees to do a diagnostic. When she comes back the following day, however, the doctor is like “what diagnostic?” Someone erased his memory. He doesn’t even remember that he found the incision on Kim. Something’s rotten in the medbay.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/AaHEjPc.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They try to go through the doctor’s photography album. It’s been deleted, though they find scraps that they can piece together to show a happy ensign on her birthday. Seven digs through the Doctor’s memory and finds that he doesn’t actually have it deleted, just locked. So he remembers snippits now. Them going on a mission, getting attacked by an unknown species.</p>

<p>He goes to the captain, and believes they’re all in danger, because he believes this alien attacker could still be nearby. Janeway tells him no, go shut down, she’ll take care of it. Instead, he sets up a chain of events where his memory will be restored if deleted, and then images taken of whoever entered. The camera has a blinking lights so whoever comes in must be an idiot for ignoring it- oh it’s Janeway.</p>

<p>The Doctor gets his memories back, and starts freaking out on the bridge about a conspiracy. Janeway explains that 18 months ago, SOMETHING happened that caused the doctor’s program to fall apart. So to avoid that memory coming back and causing problems, they’ll just erase his program. Without his consent. He’s like “That goes against my rights” and they explain he has no rights.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/W4aByk0.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Seven is disturbed by this, and talks to Janeway about it. She’s like “I’ve already decided it. And I’m in the right to, because in the end, the Doctor may SEEM Human, but he’s not. He’s just a program. He has no rights”. JANEWAY. WHAT THE FUCK. WE SOLVED THIS IN SEASON 2 OF TNG.</p>

<p>Seven admits that she’s almost more like a computer than a Human, sometimes, and is disturbed by what Janeway is doing. And they basically made HER a human, and did the same to the Doctor. Now he STILL doesn’t have rights?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/3xl1rA5.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This immediately wakes Janeway up, thankfully, who goes to the Doctor and explains that she was biased when she made her decision. At the very least, the Doctor has the right to know WHY they’re doing what they’re doing. Thank GOD. It sucks that they wrote her that way from the start, but at least it knows she’s wrong.</p>

<p>They reawaken his memories. Basically, this girl, Kim, and the Doctor went on the shuttle, and were attacked by an unknown alien. That alien hit them all with a weapon. It did nothing to the Doctor, but hit the other two, nearly killing them. Back on Voyager, the Doctor has to do surgery on them to save them. He can only choose one, however, and chooses to save Kim. Obviously. The ensign dies. Back in the future, the doctor is confounded why this would make him fall apart. He’s programmed to be able to handle shit like that.</p>

<p>They show him more. He’s having a meltdown over it. Not cause someone died, but because of his choice. Not that he had to make a choice, but how he made it. He chose the person he was closer to, Harry Kim. He feels like he failed, because that was never in his programming, it wasn’t logical. They did, indeed, make him more human, and he’s struggling with it. He gets caught in a loop. He is NOW in the future, too. He WANTS them to reprogram him again. But maybe there’s a better way this time?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/zHf0DEu.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They try a therapy situation, basically. Trying to let his program work through it, maybe get out of the loop. Janeway stays up late in the holodeck trying to talk him through it, which doesn’t seem to be helpful. It’s a slow process, though, and he’s slowly working through it. Slowly.</p>

<p>I dunno how to feel about this episode. I thought it was good. My watch partner, Neli, LOVED it. One of her favorite episodes in Voyager. She loved how it actually tackled death and trauma, a thing that Trek doesn’t tackle very well. Neli suggested that Janeway was the way she was earlier because she was trying to convince herself, and that she did it cause it was an easy way to help the Doctor get through his trauma. That… maybe? I didn’t see it that way, at all. I think she fucked up and then realized she fucked up. I dunno, I liked it I guess.</p>

<p><strong>Bride of Chaotica!</strong> - VOY
10/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/56XEgB6.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Paris and Kim are playing Captain Proton in the Holodeck. It’s a program Paris made that’s based on old shitty black and white serials. Low budget, very very funny. They go through it for a bit, occasionally making comments (“This is the same world we went to last week?” “Hey, sets were expensive.”), when they see a weird effect in the holodeck.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/QvXqaRV.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Basically, Voyager slammed into an “interstellar sandbar” that locked them in place. Whatever’s happening in the holodeck seems to just be harmless space phenomena, whatever, no big deal. Anyways it is a big deal.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/UzMaiYN.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Some people teleport into the holodeck, and are like “We come in peace, looking for other photonic life forms”. DOCTOR CHAOTICA announces WAR on these creatures, and now an armed conflict has broken out in the Holodeck. When Voyager finds out, it seems kinda nonsensical. Tuvok is SO checked out from all of this, it’s VERY funny. Vulcans have endless patience, but early 1900s media is close to running through it. Now they need to either convince these aliens they’re boxing shadows (hard since the aliens don’t think they’re real), or help them beat Chaotica so that that the Holodeck will end the program.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ti8VJdu.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Here’s Janeway’s expression to being told more about the holoprogram. It’s so fucking funny. She’s enlisted to play QUEEN ARACHNIA, another villain in the story, who can maybe stop CHAOTICA from within.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/O8S0MUn.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/MdXyghK.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This episode is so much fun</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/zF8pR56.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Here’s the Doctor playing “The President of Earth”, with his little patch. He asks the aliens for help. They need to lower their weapons so that Captain Proton can attack Chaotica. But only if Janeway on the inside can get him to lowering his lightning shield!</p>

<p>She’s captured, but manages to use her pheremones to escape. She takes control, they defeat Chaotica, and the distortions close. It ends with a little “The end…..?” with Chaotica laughing over it as it fades to black.</p>

<p>Fucking fantastic, 10/10, no notes.</p>

<p><strong>Gravity</strong> - VOY
6/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/5lL7IhQ.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We get a flashback of young Tuvok talking with a Vulcan master. Tuvok is a young Vulcan who does not want to give up his connection to emotions. “If we were born with emotions, why must we give them up? Where is the logic in that?” He seeks guidance, and the vulcan master is willing to help him learn to control his emotions.</p>

<p>Back in the present, an alien is scouring a desert world, finds a crashed shuttle, and finds Paris in there. She mugs Paris, stealing his stuff. For an ace pilot, Paris crashes a lot. She’s then attacked by some other aliens, who try and rob her. Tuvok comes and saves her, and manages to convince her he’s no threat. The translator is not working, so they cannot communicate with her. They can at least exchange names. Her name is Noss. She’s basically Tank Girl.</p>

<p>The Doctor is broken, but Paris is working on it. They go to her ship, Paris fixed the doctor, who thankfully has a working universal translator. She explains she’s been here for 13 seasons and many ships have come down, but no one’s been able to escape the planet.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/P20vv2M.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We have a time skip. Noss is learning some English, able to communicate barely. I guess this means Tuvok knows English. She befriends them, but especially Tuvok, she’s REAL into Tuvok. Oh no, this is going to be a Tuvok romance episode. For the record, Tuvok agrees, “oh no”. He has no interest. Paris tries to hook him up and he’s like “I am married?”</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/oGRqBNJ.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This is very funny out of context. Anyways Paris is being VERY weird. He claims he thinks Tuvok looks like he wishes he wasn’t Vulcan. Paris, what’s it to you buddy? We get more backstory about Tuvok being taught that Love is a dangerous emotion. Avoid it at all costs.</p>

<p>Back on Voyager, it’s been an hour since they lost sight of the shuttle. They’re scanning the dimensional sinkhole it fell into. Another alien ship is here to explain what it is, and that they will be closing it tomorrow so no one else is lost to it. So they need to try and save their crew as soon as they can.</p>

<p>Noss kisses Tuvok. He does not appreciate it. Oh boy. Paris is very annoying, but it now makes more sense when you realize that Paris has been stuck on a desert planet for like 5 months with a Vulcan. I’d be annoyed too.</p>

<p>The aliens are deciding to close the wormhole early. Why? No reason. They go “We’re going to do it now. Sorry”. I guess just to be fucking assholes, even though they know Voyager is trying to save their crewmates. I guess they can’t wait 2 fucking hours. The game is on, you understand.</p>

<p>They manage to get a message through for transport. There’s some struggle as, in just THAT moment, some aliens decide to attack them, but they make it through, all four of them.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/2gX6XcX.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They deliver Noss back to her home planet, but not before Tuvok mind melds with her to help her understand what he thinks and how he feels. She appreciates it, and they leave on good terms.</p>

<p><strong>Bliss</strong> - VOY
8/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/9cFUDwR.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We start with an alien we’ve never met yelling at nothing as his ship explodes and he flies into a weird distortion in space. “WHAT’S WRONG? CAN’T READ MY THOUGHTS?” as he flies towards it. He’s all leather and wood vibes, old creaky mother fucker. I love him and his ship.</p>

<p>Back on Voyager, they detect the wormhole. It leads DIRECTLY to Earth. Wow, convenient! They all agree, and plan to do scans. Meanwhile, Seven returns to Voyager from an outting, to find them all EXTREMELY excited about getting home. Seven is…. concerned. There’s some weird shit with this wormhole, but they’re like “oh it’s fine, we got messages from Starfleet through the wormhole!” Seven expresses concerns to Janeway, who’s like “ohhh you’re still just nervous about going to Earth. Don’t worry, it’ll be great!”</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/pXz9aKe.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>It’s all Smiley Smile cult energy, and it’s VERY uncomfy. Seven hacks Janeway’s personal logs to find that Janeway went from “This is clearly a trap” to “I set a course for the wormhole, we’ll be home soon” very VERY fast. Seven gets the Doctor in on trying to figure out what’s going on, and she finds scans of a vessel inside the wormhole. It’s the alien from the intro! He sadly goes “turn around. You’re being decieved. He Knows What You Want.”</p>

<p>WELL THAT’S CREEPY.</p>

<p>The message is cut off by Tuvok, who restricts access to Astrometrics. The Doctor is shut down, orders from Starfleet, cause the wormhole might damage him. They ALSO order Seven to be put in stasis, cause borg shenanigans. Yeah, I bet. Things are looking bad…. except for one thing. Naomi Wildman.</p>

<p>YES, SHE’S STILL HERE, AND RELEVANT! She’s confounded everyone is so creepy. She does NOT want to return to Earth either, so she appears to be immune. She and Seven try to stop this, but Seven is electrocuted at her station. They make it in. What appears to them as a wormhole appears to be a giant mouth that eats them.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/X2kVtjG.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We then get scenes of them experiencing JUST what they want to experience</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/YCutsdI.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Smash cut to them unconscious on the ground. Naomi walks through this all. Yeah this won’t be scarring for her psyche.</p>

<p>She wakes Seven up, and now it’s up to them, as the ship’s hull demolecularizes. That sounds bad.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/99rC5wG.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Seven Moms Naomi around. They need help, though. Seven contacts the alien inside, and transport him on board. He explains that this creature is a monster who telepathizes ships so that it can eat them. He’s been hunting it for 40 years, and THOGUHT he had finally found a way to kill it, but sadly it was yet another trick. They get the Doctor back up, and try to figure out a way to get the hell out of this thing. They determine a way: Using their seperate weapons, they can create a big noxious explosion that’ll give the monster a tummy ache. Cute.</p>

<p>They do, and it works! Oh wait no, it just wants Seven to think it works. She breaks the illusion with the others’ help, and then one more explosion gets them out.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/LB7bDFU.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We end with Voyager making its way off, Seven going “have the doctor explain, this was tiring and I’m going to bed”, while the alien who helped them makes his way back in. The hunt continues.</p>

<p>Good episode, I enjoyed it.</p>

<p><strong>Dark Frontier</strong> - VOY
7.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/20Urg4U.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We start with a Borg ship detecting Voyager and going to assimilate it. Voyager is like “Bad idea, leave us alone”. They do not, and are blown up. They were only meaning to disable them, but hit harder than expected. Janeway is feeling lucky today, so they decide to try and salvage the ship to get some Borg tech.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the trans warp coil is blown up. Buuuuuut, Seven detects another Borg ship on the horizon. Its weakened. You know what that means? It’s time to attack THEM and try to take a trans warp coil from them. Wow, that’s… ballsy. Seven is kinda cagey about the plan, but willing to help. They’re planning to use her parents’ notes on the attack, since they studied for Borg for years. They were studying the Borg for YEARS before most people even knew they were real. Seven is unhappy even thinking of her family, but Neelix makes her rethink her idea of just… ignoring thoughts on them.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/SD66JAe.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We get a flashback showing what happened to Seven’s family, and Humanity’s first real contact with the Borg. The Borg ignore them, but we know that won’t happen forever.</p>

<p>They do some testing on the Holodeck for their heist. It doesn’t go well. Everyone is anxious about the heist, ESPECIALLY Seven. Naomi comes to visit her, asking some question. A lot of questions. Too many questions. Then it gets worse as Naomi becomes a Borg in front of our eyes, and we find out Seven is being sent a message by the Borg.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/kPzn95A.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They let her know that the Borg knows that they know the plan, and that they WILL fail. But if Seven works with them, and goes back to them, they’ll leave Voyager alone. Why? Because Seven is unique.</p>

<p>Everyone on the crew can tell Seven is agitated, and Janeway takes her off the mission. She straight up BEGS Janeway to let her stay on the mission. Voyager is her collective, and she NEEDS them to survive. Please.</p>

<p>The heist happens. It goes, but Seven keeps being… distracted. She’s hearing voices in her head. Seven announces mid mission she’s staying, and forces them to leave without her. Janeway IMMEDIATELY tries to follow, but they warp away before they can try and rescue Seven.</p>

<p>Hey look it’s the Borg Queen! Different actress, so lots of theories about this, but it’s the Borg Queen. She does her sexy sensual thing, and Seven is confounded, like “why the hell are you talking to me and not just taking me over”. I don’t get it either. I never understood, or liked, the Borg Queen. But I fucking hated First Contact so who knows. The Borg Queen claims she LET Seven go in the first place, to gain more information. That’s why they tried to assimilate Voyager all those times, I’m sure. She ALSO claims that Seven is the only Borg who ever returned to a state of individuality. So much for Hugh. And Locutus. And all those Borg on the planet Chakotay went to??? What the hell?</p>

<p>Most of the crew have given up on Seven. Torres is like “She was never one of us :)”. What the fuck Torres. But there’s one person who knows they need to save her. Naomi. God bless Naomi. Naomi is achieving EVERYTHING that Gene Roddenberry wanted with Wesley Crusher and failed at. She’s so good.</p>

<p>The Borg Queen explains that the reason they’re doing this to Seven, and won’t immediately convert her, is because they’re trying to learn what Humans are like, so they can actually succeed at taking over Earth next time. I kind of find this dumb I’m NGL. It’s better than First Contact, at least. This is a lot less “Yes Data, be horny for me” and more abusive mother, which is at least something.</p>

<p>Janeway finds out about the transmissions from the Queen, and also finds out where Seven is. She upgrades the Delta Flyers with Transwarp, and goes after Seven. She’s one of them now.</p>

<p>Back on the Borg Sphere, the Borg Queen enlists Seven to assimilate some aliens. She does, at first, but then sneaks some out. The entire scene is MASSIVLEY stressful. I keep comparing this to First Contact, but that was TRYING to go for the horror of the situation and it fell flat. This is doing it so much better even though this is a bunch of randos, and that was a bunch of Starfleet officers. Anyways the Borg Queen finds out about it and almost captures them, but then when Seven begs the Queen to let them go, she does. Huh. Maybe she’s having more of an effect on the Borg than they think she is.</p>

<p>Hey look, it’s Seven’s dad! Poor Seven.</p>

<p>Janeway and Tuvok beam onto the Queen’s vessel, both packing serious heat. Rick Berman must be on vacation again, they let Janeway carry a gun. She storms her way in to the Queen’s quarters, and has a stand off with her, before Paris beams them all out.</p>

<p>A Borg ship chases after them, but they make it back, Voyager blowing up Transwarp conduit behind them. Or so they thought. The conduit opens a gain, with LOTS of Borg signatures. Oh it’s just the ship they blew up that’s in a million pieces.</p>

<p>They use the transwarp coil and get 15 years closer to home, and far away. Seven is back home, where she belongs.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="Voyager" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry></feed>
