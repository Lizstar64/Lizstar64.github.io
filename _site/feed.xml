<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p><strong>Collective</strong> - VOY
9/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Hh1jPt5.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Some miners are excited to meet Voyager and make a deal with them. Apparently Voyager needs some Dolomite to save sick kids, so they’ll trade some dilithium for it. The away team beams down and uh, uh oh. That don’t look like Tuvok.</p>

<p>So yeah, some people are impersonating Voyager. They steal the Dolomite and get the fuck out. Meanwhile, ACTUAL Voyager is dealing with some nonsense. Janeway tries to shower and her shower screams at her and breaks the mirror. Imagine how horrifying that’d be. They find the problem, and it’s a thing given to them by some monks who were raising money for sick orphans. Ahh, I see.</p>

<p>We find out that Neelix and Tom got cheated by this group. The girl of the group was VERY excited to hear a WOMAN was in charge of the Voyager. Also there’s a B plot about how Tom and Neelix are grumpy that they got marked. Can you imagine a B plot that’s fun, AND fits the actual episode and builds from the A plot?</p>

<p>After Voyager gets yelled at by some angry miners, it’s time for a hunt. They find them being attacked by another mark, who then turns on them thinking they’re the Voyager protecting the Delta Flyer. The “Delta Flyer” gets away, but they get “Captain Janeway”.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/lXVVrLP.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We get some fun shit with Janeway trying to con this conwoman. She makes Tuvok lie. Tuvok is not good at lying. Neelix goes to the conwoman, Dala, and tries to be nice at her. He gets his ass kicked and she escapes with his gun. Neelix, why did you bring a gun in??? OH it’s cause they were intentionally letting her escape so she’d lead them to them.</p>

<p>The episode from this point off is like the old ball and cup game that Neelix and Tom are playing. Lots of deception and hand offs. Turns out Tom snuck aboard the delta flier that Dala stole. They then do a teleporter switcheroo and replace her with the Doctor, who “betrays” them as Dala.</p>

<p>Also one of the impersonators has been REALLY getting into the character of Tuvok. When he meets Tuvok he’s so excited and is like “logic dictates neither of us have the advantage in this fight” and Tuvok goes “Your logic is flawed” and beats his ass, it’s good.</p>

<p>This episode is goofy and fun.</p>

<p><strong>Muse</strong> - VOY
7.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/krN9CLf.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>On a primitive, Ancient Greek-like planet, a play is put on about some a Voyager story, where Torres crashes onto their shores after sending Kim out an escape pod. The patron of the play loved it, and is excited to hear more stories about this Torres. The Poet, Kelis, is apprehensive, but can’t resist his patron. He then goes off to his muse… who happened to be a captured Belanna Torres in a crashed Delta Flyer not far from there.</p>

<p>Torres comes to, and is like “wtf is going on also why did you cut me up” “Oh I was releasing the heat from your body, that’s how you treat fever :D” “Oh god.” While she was out, he listened to her audio logs and wrote about it. He believes she’s an “Eternal”, a god basically. But she’s a new Eternal they’ve never heard of, from a new clan. It’s got some Steven King Misery energy. Torres agrees that if he lets her go, she’ll give him some more stories. She kinda leans into the “I’m a god” thing by saying they have rules, and then almost shoots him to get him to leave. But when things aren’t going so well, she can’t fix her ship, and is hungry, so he feeds her in exchange for stories.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/bBaVfwi.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They make a new deal. Some dilithium, which is only on his patron’s lands, or no more stories about Voyager. Don’t get caught :). Their partnership is VERY strenuous. He’s not unfriendly, but Torres is Torres.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/H0cRd8b.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>LOL this dude trying to teach his actors how to play his parts, and getting REAL into the specifics. No no NO, a Borg wouldn’t act like that!! No no no, LOGICAL Klingons do not CRY!!</p>

<p>His Patron is going to war soon, which will cause famine and kill a lot of people. But Kelis has a plan… a SHOCKINGLY progressive one. Her magic cannot stop a war or change minds, sure, how you know what can? Culture. Writing. Words. We can write a play to try and convince the world of peace. He convinces her to come and help him directly. But no one but the players can know she’s an Eternal, or the patron might try and capture her to get her to help him declare war.</p>

<p>It doesn’t go well at first. The most he can think to do to bring passion to the play is make everyone kiss. Torres and him talk it through, and he decides a good idea is to instead have an enemy, the Borg, and the Borg Queen. . Captain Janeway goes on a mission of vengeance, but finds instead the desire to bring peace. That’s a good ending!</p>

<p>There’s also a thing with the poet’s lover being jealous. She claims if Torres shows up she’ll expose her as an Eternal. Ah, the woms be cray cray. And Harry Kim finding Torres. He explains that he landed 100km away and walked. Holy SHIT, Harry. With Harry’s help they contact Voyager. They’re gonna be alright! But what about the play? :o Torres finds she’s REALLY gotten into this play. So she teleports in to save the play.</p>

<p>The lead actress, in a fit of jealousy does in fact cry out that Torres is really an Eternal, but he’s like “Oooh it’s part of the show :D”.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/A1Zsgal.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Nice cute scene with her in the end as she beams away, saying that they don’t need her, as long as they do what’s right. It’s a cute episode in all!</p>

<p><strong>Fury</strong> - VOY
5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/rTp11NS.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Janeway is grumpy that Tuvok has been hiding something from her… Oh, it’s his birthday! Aww. He blows out the candle, but only cause it’s a fire hazard. Anyways then Kes shows up, demands to be let on board, beams on board just before ramming her ship into Voyager, and walks down the hall as it explodes like its a fucking action movie. Huh.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ujcT4Ey.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>She’s causing bulkhead explosions and harming people as she walks down the halls, using magic mind powers to do it. So many people are PROBABLY dead. Torres at the very least is dead, but probably so many more. Kes touches the warp core then vorps out of our reality and into the past.</p>

<p>Back in the past, she’s sneaking around the ship, morphing herself into a young version of herself. She captures her younger self in the hydroponics bay, which I don’t actually think we’ve seen since Kes left Voyager a few seasons ago.</p>

<p>It’s fun to see a Voyager that’s pretending to be season 1. Janeway has her bun. Doctor can’t just wander everywhere. Kes and Neelix are dating. We even see Naomi’s mom!! I wanted to find ANYTHING they fucked up, but the only thing I could find is that they were still using that weird dead lipstick that they’ve been using for Janeway this entire season.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/wFTzYHz.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Back in the past, they’re trying to avoid some Vidiians, which Kes is taking some real interest in. Also Tuvok is getting confused. He’s talking about the Delta Flyer, staring at Kes like “I sense a disturbance in the Logic”, and sees Naomi Wildman in the elevator. He then wanders into a Borg infested cargo bay. Weird. He goes to explain it to the Captain, explaining what happened. Which sets in to motion that they know something is up.</p>

<p>She scans Tuvok to see what’s up as he has a seizure, and they realize it’s Tachyons. Those mother fuckers again!! Just as the Vidiians show up and attack on Kes’ suggestion and orders. Ey, the first continuity error, they’re using the wrong phaser rifles! Janeway confronts Kes who’s like “I was corrupted by your ideas, a CHILD! You took me from my home! I BELIEVED YOU!” Okay Kes, whatever. Janeway ends up having to murder Kes, and they manage to hold off the Vidiians. Everything is alright. For now. She needs to stop this from happening again. Time to cause a temporal paradox!! Or y’know, multiverse theory shenanigans.</p>

<p>In the future, everything happens as usual. JAneway had ALMOST forgotten, but once Kes shows back up, she evacuates Deck 11 and puts on shields, avoids her from blowing up most of the ship. Most of the damage is reduced, but not entirely. At least there’s no deaths.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/5yzoY7j.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Kes’s hologram shows up and talks to older Kes, begging her to not do this. Trying to get her to remember who she was. She eventually seems to come to a weird understanding, she had kinda forgotten somehow?? She comes to her senses and is no longer violent, and decides to go home. Back 30,000 light years I guess. It’ll only take her six fucking years.</p>

<p>I feel this episode didn’t explain or show the reason why Kes would suddenly be evil. Ocampan Dementia??? I dunno. IT’s not explained well at all, and so it kinda falls flat. The novels apparently make this even worse, cause Kes merges with another Ocampan who’s pregnant with a caretaker and makes an evil Kes clone, it sounds stupid as fuck.</p>

<p><strong>Life Line</strong> - VOY
7.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/WBELKzi.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>More than just an infuriating but weirdly fun PS2 game, it’s another episode about the Alpha Quadrant! Barclay has gotten in contact with Voyager and the Pathfinder project is going amazingly. What ISN’T going well is his mentor’s health. Dr. Zimmerman, the man who invented the EMH, is sick and dying and no one knows why. Last time we saw this guy he was a horrible dickhead to Bashir.</p>

<p>Back on Voyager, they get good news. The Pathfinder Project has found a way to send information! A datastream. It uses a quaser, but only works once a month. They can send info back up to 16 hours later. Letters from home. Sounds nice. Everyone gets letters, including the Doctor! It’s from Barclay, who wanted to let him know that Zimmerman has only a few months to live. They never “met” really, but the Doctor views him as a kind of doctor, and thinks he can cure him using some Vidiian and Borg technology! He asks to be sent in the datastream, which no one is SUPER happy about, but they allow him to cause he’s VERY adamant about this. It doesn’t go well.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/tBvYykk.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Zimmerman is, as usual, the absolute worst. He looks down on the doctor cause he’s a lowly mark 1. He intentionally sabatoges the doctor’s attempts to scan him. He’s just a general nuisance. The Doctor can’t leave for another month, so he just has to put up with it. Also, the actor is AMAZING with this, Zimmer man has such a different way of talking as Zimmerman, it stands out. Reg wants to help, so he also calls the only person who MIGHT be able to help. Troi is here! She wants to try and counsel Zimmerman. Good luck, girl.</p>

<p>Obviously it doesn’t go well. Zimmerman is very bad at dealing with people, and frankly so is the doctor. But EVENTUALLY they get through to him because Zimmerman is only good with one thing, and thats holograms. He has two friends. One is Reg, and the other is his assistant, who is a hologram. Older than the mark 1, even. And when the Doctor’s program is in danger, he DOES step up to fix him. THough he also tries to “make him better”, which the doctor does NOT want.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/eK4bLo6.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Eventually they come to an understanding. Zimmerman is pissed at the EMH and hates it, because it was his biggest failure. And it’s a failure BECAUSE of him. He made it just like him, and no one fucking likes him. They’re all literally scrubbing barges now, all with his face.</p>

<p>Also it turns out Reg set up a thing to cause the degredation in the Doctor’s program and almost destroy him. All to try and push for this to happen. And it worked! Zimmerman FINALLY allows the doctor to work on him, and it works out. Cute episode. I hope the Doctor doesn’t return to find that everyone is dead cause of Tom being the surgeon on call.</p>

<p><strong>The Haunting of Deck Twelve</strong> - VOY
8.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/0r5GCuU.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Something is happening, and they need to turn off the power as they move through a nebula. All of the power is shut off and they float through. As it turns off, the kids wake up from their regeneration, and Neelix is there as their chaperone! He has stories and games! But they’re interested in one thing in particular. Naomi has told them there’s a GHOST on their deck… so Neelix has them gather around, and tells them a ghost story. It’s time for an episode of ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE TREK!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Q3p69Yf.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Several months ago, before the kids had come aboard, they were in a nebula, sucking up Deuterium from it, when they were ZAPPED by something! Something had boarded Voyager… ooooh, ghosties! Things start malfunctioning. Anything they try to figure out why it’s happening isn’t working. Chakotay almost dies as the elevator breaks. Seven is trapped by force fields and poisoned by the creation of a micro nebula.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/s1q86nz.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The kids are very into the story.</p>

<p>More problems happen. All of them seem to relate to the idea of re-creating the nebula they were in before. Also that Bajoran from the lower decks episode is here! I liked her, even if the episode was kinda meh. She’ll never appear again. Anyways all the banter on this is REALLY good. Voyager suffered in the early days from a Lack of Banter, which is SUCH a Trek thing. Good Trek Needs Banter. The episode is KINDA like that episode of TNG where everyone is split up into groups as the Enterprise is broken down. We’ve got Neelix and Tuvok, Tuvok trying to calm Neelix as he has panic attacks. Kim and the Bajoran trying to find others. And the Captain trying to communicate with this thing taking over her ship, which is communicating through the computer’s syntax. “Captain Janeway, please report” kinda stuff.</p>

<p>THey learn it joined by accident during the nebula destabelizing, and when they go to try and return it, they find it gone, fully. Its home is gone, so it decides to blow up Voyager. Everyone has to evacuate.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Dcyco3b.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The creature won’t let Janeway go though, and almost kills her, but she convinces it to let them take back control of their ship. This was of course, just them delivering the lifeform. Unless of course, everything Neelix made up was fake. The powe rcomes back on, and Neelix packs up. Of course it WAS true, and he hopes it lives happily ever after as they leave the nebula behind.</p>

<p><strong>Unimatrix Zero</strong> - VOY
6/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/n1yRfwl.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We start with the Borg Queen harassing some drone and being overly evil mustache twirlingly villainy about dismantling him because he has a disease. I really, really dislike the Borg Queen. Always have. They needed a villain for people to latch onto but she makes NO sense for the Borg and she’s SO human-y in her evilness, like, she’s NOT Borg, at all. It’s annoying. She even uses contractions! What kind of a Borg uses contractions?!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Seven is dreaming. She hates it. Of course she does.</p>

<p>Tom comes to work and everyone is grumpy with him. He finds a box on his chair, and what’s in it? Oh, why it’s a pip! He’s being promoted back up to Lieutenant! :D Good for you, Mr. Paris. I guess they got tired of writing around it. Also this happens.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/JC4uvlW.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Oh Harry, you know you’re never getting promoted.</p>

<p>Someone in Seven’s dream contacts her. He explains this isn’t a real dream, it’s a a shared dream amongst the borg, specifically ones with a genetic mutation. They’ve been here in the dream for years. They all know each other and interract each night. Seven did this every night for 16 years, and made lots of friends there, as she’s told. This seems like it was just written up now, and not quite fits in. Anyways they call it Unimatrix Zero, and some of the people there want Seven to help them break them out doing some technobabble and making the entirety of Borg join Unimatrix Zero.</p>

<p>Tuvok uses Vulcan Magic to link Janeway with Seven’s mind and send them both into Unimatrix Zero. At the same time, the Queen is being stupid and I hate her, and she’s like “It is time to PAY THEM A VISIT, MUAHAHAHA”</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/6MjouqL.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They invade the dream and assimilate them in the dream so they can find where exactly they are. Janeway fights them off with a fucking Batleth that she picks up from a fallen Klingon. When the Borg Queen sees her….</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/nke07r9.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Apparently they’re rivals or something. I guess she DID ruin her plans for Locutus 2.0.</p>

<p>They develop a virus that will not only protect the dreamers from being found like that, while also making sure they wake up with memories. They need to do a dangerous thing to try and spread it through the Borg, but they gotta do it. They get a message, though. Kim does the whole “Captain, I think it’s for you” thing that makes this feel like a TNG movie more than a Trek episode.</p>

<p>She offers them transwarp if they fuck off. That’s honestly the funniest thing. “You’re such a god damn hassle, please leave”. Janeway refuses, she’d prolly be betrayed anyway tbf. They begin the operation, infiltrating a Borg Cube, with the Queen watching like “Ohhh I expected more from you” like she’s a fucking Batman villain watching Batman sneak around her hideout. The Borg also blow up the Delta Flyer. Rip Delta Flyer.</p>

<p>They’re all caught and injected with nanoprobes, assimilating them. “So far so good,” Chokie says, leaving, and we get a scene of Janeway and the others as drones</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/5cRYkgC.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>To be continued!</p>

<p>One more season, so only like five more weeks of Voyager. This was a GOOD season? Like, the best Voyager season by far. Some stinkers, but a LOT of good episodes. Very worth watching.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="Voyager" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 151</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/06/13/OOCY151.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 151" /><published>2025-06-13T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-06-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/06/13/OOCY151</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/06/13/OOCY151.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/7yBCJie.png" alt="A panel from some Yuri Manga.

<p>So I got on a bit of a text adventure kick. We’ll be seeing a lot of them in the coming bit. This is a 1981 graphical text adventure by none other than Sierra Entertainment, who’d go on to be fucking humongous in the 80s. But this is still pretty dman early in their career. Hell, they’re still just called “On-Line” at this point, they’re not even Sierra yet.</p>

<p>This is one of the games in the “Hi-Res Adventure” series, a series of games for the Apple II that are text adventures, but with graphical images to show a general idea of where you are. A cute idea for the time, though the art is usually pretty…. rough. There’s this vibe that early Apple II art has that just tells me it was made by people who never actually learned how to make art. Perspective is wrong, things are just off, and god forbid if we get humanoid shapes. You don’t NEED to have the graphics on if they’re distracting though.</p>

<p>One of the weirder things about this is it’s actually a port. This was made by someone named Larry Ledden for Atari 8-bit computers. Sierra acquired the rights to port it and make a graphical version, which they did, though Ledden isn’t even given credit in this version.</p>

<p>Cranston Manor is a simple game with a lot of the trappings of other text adventures of the day. In it, you just sneak into the manor of a dead millionaire and steal the 16 treasures that are kept inside. That’s very Zork. In Zork, your goal is to wander around, solve simple puzzles, explore, and find treasures to bring back to a central location. This is basically just that, but with a manor.</p>

<p>As a text adventure, it’s perfectly fine. A little confusing at times? But the puzzles aren’t overly complex. Like for example, uh, there’s a robot that follows you to make sure you don’t steal anything. But he’s afraid of mice, so you take some cheese and mice start following you, so he runs away from you. Simple, right?</p>

<p>Over all, this isn’t a text adventure anyone remembers or talks about, but it’s an interesting blip in Sierra’s history!</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Apple II" /><category term="Obscure Games" /><category term="Sierra" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 150</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/06/09/OOCY150.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 150" /><published>2025-06-09T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-06-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/06/09/OOCY150</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/06/09/OOCY150.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/wVAfhxR.png" alt="'The feeling of a nipple!

<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p><strong>Collective</strong> - VOY
7/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/mKb6LNM.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Tom, Kim, Chokie, and Neelix are in the Delta Flyer shooting the shit and playing Poker. It’s cute. Neelix hustles them, Kim calls it the “Innocent Talaxian Routine”. Then oh, whoopsies, Borg Cube on the horizon. The Borg being weirdly sneeksy. Don’t they have like, alerts or sensors for that??</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/UcprNmf.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They explain they used a “Disperal Field” to mask their approach, which is a thing you can do? That sounds like they should do that all the damn time. They’re captured, and it’s now Neelix, Chokie, and Paris. Kim is missing. They wake up in an assimilation chamber, but they’re feeling pretty unassimilated. Voyager chases after them, and knocks them down to size. It’s weirdly too easy. Janeway tries to communicate with them, and they want a deflector dish for the crewmen they have captured. Why? It seems that their link with the collective has been severed, and they need it to call for reinforcements. Don’t want THAT. Seven beams over to try and secure their crewmates. What does she find? Children.</p>

<p>Borg Children. So, that IS kind of a thing. But usually they are just in muturation chambers until they fully grow. The adult Borg are missing, and now it’s just five. They’re confused, erratic and irrational, especially the one who’s basically taken control. So now we got terrifying children. My favorite!</p>

<p>They bring back a dead Borg and study it. It got sick. They can have the pathogen up and use it as a weapon (which the Doctor is VERY unhappy about), but its good to have the option in case we really want to kill these children. Because they ARE just children.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/uVjGBJ8.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Harry was never captured. They didn’t find him in the tubes of the Delta Flyer, so he’s our wild card for this episode.</p>

<p>It’s a group of five children, but it’s really just one bully bullying the other four to do what he wants, and he DEMANDS they return to the collective. Once they get another distress beacon out, the Borg will come and save them. Seven makes it clear that the Borg actually DID get their distress beacon, but decided they’re just not worth it. They don’t even want the CUBE? Damn. Janeway thinks they should just try and re-individualize these kids, like with Seven, but Seven is like “Captain that was hard with me, and I wasn’t a child. It’s gonna be impossible.” But if ANYONE can be Borg Mom, it’s her.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/hlvZPnv.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Another maturation chamber breaks and they have to take a baby out of it. It’s a horrible rubber baby thing. Anyways, they find Kim, and inject shit into him cause Kim Must Suffer. They decide to saw fuck it with any deals and just tries to rip the deflector dish off Voyager, which WILL blow Voyager up. But they bounce a graviton particle beam off it and blow up the tractor beam, which ALSO feels like they should do THAT more often, and it starts to blow up the Cube. The other Borg Kids stand up to the Bully, who then gets killed in an Explodium Accident, and they beam over to Voyager.</p>

<p>They’re trying to find homes for these kids cause WOW Voyager is not a good place for kids, but for now, Seven has to look after these kids. Will they be important in the future? Time will tell!</p>

<p><strong>Spirit Folk</strong> - VOY
8.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/K1CxbN3.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Paris is back in the Fair Haven program, I guess because they all still had access to the lot. Tom is driving around in a shitty old car, and breaks his wheel. He has the computer just make him a new one, but a hologram sees it and is like “oh that’s not normal”</p>

<p>We then get all the Irish holograms in the hologram pub like “clearly they are the fae folk”. Well, two of them are REAL into the idea, at least. How the hell are these Holograms able to do this? Wouldn’t they have programmed some kind of safety in so that they don’t notice the computer doing things? Other programs don’t have that problem. Well, I have a good answer for that. Shut up, who  cares. I like excuses for things to be stupid.</p>

<p>The drunks see Harry and a girl on a date, and then the girl turns into a cow. Tom is pranking Kim. But they just saw a townsfolk turn into a fuckin’ cow. When Harry and Kim wander off, leaving the Cow (they’re called to the bridge), the drunkards take the cow and bring it to church.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/e27131C.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The Doctor is telling a sermon when they bring in the cow. He fixes the problem, but not in a super subtle way. Everyone begins to connect the dots and talk about all the small things they’ve seen. Time to burn the witches!! Janeway’s boyfriend confronts her about it. Huh.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/MRzoi2d.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Well, something is clearly broken. They bring up Janeway’s boyfriend and yep, he’s got some broken files. Those files are supposed to stop him from noticing anything’s wrong. Why is this happening? Well, they’re running Fairhaven nonstop. They just lef tthe computer on too long, you understand. So they’re gonna go and fix the problem by doing something in the pub. But Sullivan, the boyfriend, warns everyone. So now they’re PREPARED. They start up a wild witch hunt and riot to burn them out cause oh no scary things we don’t understand. Yeah that’s prolly how it’d go.</p>

<p>They shoot at them, and blow apart the safeties as they hit the computer panels. Welp. Now they have Kim and Tom tied up, so they need to get people in there to help them. Luckily the Doctor is the preacher, so he can just convince them to stop!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/UZgTAI2.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This is one of the best images we’ve captured for Voyager.</p>

<p>Anyways the Doctor is captured, and his mobile emitter is removed from him, so he becomes frazzled by the Holodeck’s errors. So he becomes hypnotized and tells them everything. All the simple folk don’t understand, or care, but Sullivan does. He kind of gets it, he’s a science man, so he asks to be taken to Voyager. He uses the Holo-Emitter, and goes out into Voyager.</p>

<p>They show him around, and explain to him what’s going on. He’s a pretty good guy so he takes it shockingly in stride. “Just cause we’re from different worlds doesn’t mean we can’t care for each other”. He helps stop them from burning Harry and Kim alive, and everything is okay. Now they just think they’re space men from the future. It’s not quite the same, but it feels weird to just erase their memories. They can’t just keep the open door policy though and keep it on for any longer. Things can always get worse. Janeway and Sullivan have one last cute moment, and then he’s NEVER SEEN AGAIN, OOOOOOH</p>

<p><strong>Ashes to Ashes</strong> - VOY
7/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/TUweOX8.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We see an alien fleeing some people chasing and attacking her, speaking in another language. Then, in English, she sends out a request to Voyager for aid. She looks like an Asari, and is just as hot.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on Voyager, one of the Borg Kids finds the message from the alien, who is kinda humored by the idea that a KID is answering her distress call, and asks her patch her over to Janeway. But the message cuts off before she can. The Borg Kid is being chased by the adults who are like “You are NOT supposed to be here”. But then they find out about the alien, and patch her over after all.</p>

<p>She identifies herself as Ensign Lyndsay Ballard, who was a member of the crew a few years ago and died. They don’t trust her, which she’s not offended by, and explains that after she died in an accident, she was found by some aliens, the Kobali. Basically they revive dead aliens and turn them into them as a way to procreate. WEIRD ass way to procreate. Her story seems to check out. Kim is kind of FLOORED by this, because she died on an away mission with him.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/MqEUgTR.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The Kobali are still hunting her. See, this is why this is a weird way to procreate. Of course she wouldn’t want to stay with some new family, why the fuck would they even do this??? At least erase their desire to escape or something while you’re in there bringing them back from the dead?</p>

<p>Lyndsay is VERY pleasant. She’s funny and sassy in a way I like. “This is so weird for me,” says Kim. “Really? This is just a normal day for me.” or she goes “Hey, show some respect for the dead”.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Borg Kids are hard to wrangle and Seven is trying to be very disciplined as their new mother. It is not working. I’m more interested in the Lyndsay stuff. She tries to assimilate back in, and is taking cosmetic surgery to appear more Human, basically. But she’s been with the Kobali for three years, so it’s a bit weird. She slips into another language, food doesn’t taste the same.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/4jtSmNG.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Hey look her surgery is going well, she’s really cute.</p>

<p>Kim is thinking of asking her on a date, but he’s cucked by the Captain, who already invited her to dinner. Unfortunately, she seems to have a mental breakdown at dinner, after she asks why the Captain sent her on the away mission even though others, like Torres, were better suited for it. Was it cause she was expendable? But she’s not upset, because Kobali don’t get upset about whoever caused their death- ohhh no. After her freakout she has a nightmare, and then she goes to Kim, who comforts her, and they kiss. Sorry Captain, looks like you lost.</p>

<p>BTW at dinner, Janeway ruins a potroast she’s replicating, somehow. And they’re talking about weapons they can use against the Kobali if they come back, and Lyndsay asks “have you tried using your potroast?” and then is STUNNED she did that, but we’re like “HOLY SHIT THAT WAS SO FUNNY”</p>

<p>And then her Kobali dad shows up like “I only want to  speak to her”. They allow him to, cause she allows it. He explains that USUALLY memories don’t come back, but sometimes they do, and things like this happen. And then what happens is basically a trans allegory. “What did they do to you, Jetlaya? You were so beautiful before.” “My name is not Jetlaya, it’s Lyndsay.” Constantly calling her what she doesn’t want to be, telling her she’s confused and… it’s kinda gross and uncomfy and now I’m REALLY nervous about how this episode is going to go??? He tells her that Lyndsay died years ago, and she can’t be that person now. He’s also willing to blow himself up, cause he refuses to go home alone, because that’s his daughter.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/WK3rza7.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Things unravel more. She doesn’t remember some things, like her original dad. She’s still thinking things in the alien language, not English. She realizes it’s not Voyager that’s different, it’s her, so she can’t stay. As the Kobali attack, Kim is all pissy about letting her go even though she’s said she WANTS to go, and suggests blowing up her dad’s ship which like, what the fuck Kim. She tells him the girl he loved died a while ago, and he has to let her go. I don’t know how to feel about this anymore. I like the idea of it, and the sci-fi-ness of it, but I think parts of it aren’t done very well. Ironically, she’s way too likable. They also didn’t do well enough to really explore the differences and why she’d want to stay.</p>

<p><strong>Child’s Play</strong> - VOY
7.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/VCECQZK.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>There’s a science fair, all the kids are showing off their science projects. Seven is VERY proud of her kids. One of them LITERALLY made an Alien Ant Farm. But things hit a bit of a snag, when she finds out that one of them is going to leaving soon, as they’ve found his family. She is NOT happy. Oh no, Empty Nest Seven.</p>

<p>For what its worth, Icheb isn’t very happy about this either. He doesn’t remember his family. They’re not technologically advanced, and he’s VERY into astronomical stuff that he can’t study, at all, living on a farm. Honestly, all very fair. Everyone tells him he should be happy and it’ll be GOOD for him to be with his “real” parents but he already HAS “real” parents and people to care for him here.</p>

<p>Also the planet here is a lightyear away from a Borg warp conduit and so they’ve been attacked by the Borg a lot. Gee, sounds like a great place to drop this kid off at.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/4itDFUJ.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>It doesn’t go well. Icheb is not interested in returning, and Seven is unhappy because she doesn’t think they can care for him properly. Which they can’t, like, obviously. “We can’t LEAVE this planet, it’s our home! We will defend it to the last against the Borg!” Well, poor Icheb is gonna be reassimilated ain’t he</p>

<p>They push him to at least TRY. He’s grumpy, but he tries, and does kinda get back into the spirit of it. He enjoys their food,  his favorite when he was a kid, tries to interract with the people down there. They can’t provide for his dreams, but he’s very smart. They need smart people like him to help them survive, it’s a rough world.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/qxQWnyu.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Eventually he decides he does, in fact, want this. There’s a thing about how home is so important, and they prove it to him by explaining how Voyager is trying so hard to get home. Okay y’all. There’s a heartfelt goodbye as he teleports off to his new home. The episode is not over yet, that’s not a good sign. The other kids are sad. They’re like “I hope you don’t find my parents, I want to stay here”. Damn kids. Seven ALSO learns that Icheb’s father lied to them about both when Icheb was taken, AND where. Clearly something is sussy. Seven demands they turn around and rescue him, and Janeway’s like “Seven it’s 3 in the morning”</p>

<p>They go back anyway, and it turns out they’re basically sacrificing their children, infecting them with a pathogen and making a bouy with kids on them that are infected so that they can fight off the Borg. “This is what we HAVE to do to survive! With us being so close to the Borg, it’s the only way!”</p>

<p>THEN.</p>

<p>FUCKING.</p>

<p>MOVE.</p>

<p>I will NEVER respect this argument. YOU ARE IN SPACE. THERE ARE OTHER PLACES TO LIVE. If a fucking volcano appeared next to my house I wouldn’t be like “Time to throw kids into the lava to try and calm it” I’d fucking MOVE.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/xcNXXnx.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They save Icheb from the Borg Sphere zoom the fuck out of there. Icheb is finding it hard to get past, and blame, his parents for what they did. But yeah it was fucked up. Seven is piiiiissed at them. And if he DOES want to fight the Borg in the future, he can decide to, in his own way. I’m sure that won’t be relevent.</p>

<p><strong>Good Sheppard</strong> - VOY
5.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/eWzgRPF.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We get a bunch of shots of some random lower deck crewmen going about their day. A Bajoran bringing a message from Seven to Engineering, an Engineer taking that message to another Engineer, who’s a kind of sassy bitchy dude who’s annoyed he has to actually do work. There’s also a sick-ass shot of them moving out through the window to the outside of the ship. Well I dunno what any of this means but, cool.</p>

<p>Seven is working on grading everyone on their efficiency. Harry’s late night crew has not enough to do. There’s a hypochondriac who’s afraid of medicine who’s slowing down medicine, a slightly incompetent astrometrics specialist, and a VERY competent engineer who doesn’t actually want to do any work. Three problem children. What to do? Janeway decides that these three have slipped through the cracks, and she needs to do something about it, so she decides to take them with her on an away mission to get to know them better. Two of them are actually perfectly happy to go on the away mission, maybe a bit nervous. The lazy one is NOT happy lol. Seven doesn’t think that it’s a good idea. Janeway counters her with Random Biblical Shit, citing the story of the Good Sheppard not letting even one member of her flock go.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/FpomEh6.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>I know this is going to go pear shaped, but I kinda want this to just be a normal field trip. Oh sorry, I did that wrong. PLEASE LET THIS BE A NORMAL FIELDTRIP. WITH THE JANEWAY? NO WAY! AWWWWW.</p>

<p>The Hypochrondriac and the incompetent one are nice. The Genius But Lazy one I want to punch in the face. He’s like Distilled Big Bang Theory. Well okay, the Hypochondriac tries to get out of the away mission because he’s been infected by a fucking prion disease. How many mad cows are you eating in the Delta Quadrant, ensign???</p>

<p>Janeway is trying to connect with these random misfits, and it’s not going great, but then they get hit by something that tears off a piece of the hull and knocks out a lot of systems. Lazy guy assumes it’s a phenomena he’s theorized about, but has no proof of, and he’s betting EVERYTHING on it. Alright dude.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/sD05UVd.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>I really, REALLY feel for this girl. She’s not like, actually dumb or incompetent. Her skills just aren’t really for what they’ve got going on here. She was put here as a sympathy hire cause she’s Bajoran, or at least that’s how she feels.</p>

<p>Shit gets worse as another anomaly comes at them. They try to distract it with a photon torpedo, and then the hypochrondriac goes “oh no” and is teleported out.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/xzFlvNY.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>He’s teleported back, with the feeling of something inside him, crawling around. It sounds MASSIVELY uncomfortable. Oh my god, he’s going to get Alien’d. Anyways it turns out the lazy shithead is a shithead, he’s awful. When an alien DOES burst out, he IMMEDIATELY goes blasting, killing something that might not have been violent or dangerous. Now we’ll never know. All we know is that the Hypochondriac could feel its thoughts, specifically “Do not belong”. Before it left, it maybe cured him of his hypochondria. Janeway thinks that since he actually DID have something, it kinda scared him cured. Okay, sure.</p>

<p>Janeway demands they abandon ship and leave her as she makes a stand against the aliens coming at her. They refuse. Well, the two good ones refuse. The lazy one gets in an escape pod, but then sacrifices himself, cause “maybe I’ll understand what I’m missing”. It really just adds more for them to do, cause now they have to rescue him too. come on, man. They do a maneuver, and an explosion happens, and then they wake back up on Voyager. The end.</p>

<p>Didn’t really land the ending. We needed one more scene where it shows they belong here now, instead of Janeway just going “it’s okay, they belong here now”. Aight.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="Voyager" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Retro Achievement Mastery 182 - Zork I</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/06/08/RA182-Zork.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Retro Achievement Mastery 182 - Zork I" /><published>2025-06-08T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-06-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/06/08/RA182-Zork</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/06/08/RA182-Zork.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/wcR0ZN7.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>So I recently played Return to Zork, and talked a bit about the later Zork series, but I cannot stress enough how big Zork really was. Like, it was HUGE. One of the first big smash video games. Originally released in 1977 for mainframe computers, it had to be split into three parts with later home computer releases cause they couldn’t even handle it. Only one of these actually has achievements so far, so I’m just playing Zork 1 for now.</p>

<p>Zork is not the first text adventure. It was inspired by Colossal Cave Adventure, which also wasn’t the first, but was probably the first well known one. Well, well known among nerds. The creators of Zork all worked at MIT and were huge nerds. Zork itself is based on a Huge Nerd terminology. It was slang around the office. The word “Zork” was just the file name MIT nerds in the 70s used for programs they hadn’t named yet, and then it stuck and they didn’t want to change it to anything else.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/lsTo4hy.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Zork is weird and irreverent. It’s built on fantasy games like D&amp;D and whatnot, but it’s also got a lot of American energy to it. The way I always describe it is, Zork is Midwest America’s Discworld. A lot of that is still here in the first one, but to a lesser degree. The lore of Flatheads is kinda here, we have the Dam here, you can visit it.</p>

<p>Zork is really just a giant maze, with some smaller mazes thrown in, and a lot of really weird “puzzles” that usually involve bringing an item from one far off room to another. Once you break it down into its constituent parts, it really isn’t that complex and doesn’t take a long time. Fuck, you can turn the entire winning playthrough into a song. Here you go: https://debsanderrol.bandcamp.com/track/walkthrough</p>

<p>Is Zork GOOD to play these days? Eh. It’s more interesting than anything, and I have a deep love for it, but like, there are much better text adventures to play, even. Just play Zork Zero.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Apple II" /><category term="Retro Games" /><category term="Zork" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry></feed>
