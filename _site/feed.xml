<p>So I mastered Zelda 2. Then I did it again with Zelda 2 on GBA. No more ports, thats it, right? ): Well what about romhacks?? This is a Zelda 2 romhack by GTM604, and it’s often considered the best Zelda 2 romhack of all time. This was also my FIRST Zelda 2 romhack, so I have nothing to compare it to. Though uh… hmm… Okay so, I can see why people love this. There’s a lot to love. It’s a well crafted hack.</p>

<p>It pissed me off beyond belief.</p>

<p>All of the reviews of this hack proclaim how it’s impressive that they made a good solid hack but didn’t make it impossible like all the other Zelda 2 hacks. I’m TERRIFIED to play other Zelda 2 romhacks now, because this is hard in a way I don’t appreciate. Zelda 2 is hard, yes, and I like a good challenge, and I know people will disagree with me here, but Zelda 2 is fair. This hack is not fair in a lot of parts. But we’ll get into it…</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/WPVOqfA.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Set as a sequel to Zelda 2, Ganon is defeated, Zelda is wakened, all is good and happy. However, Ganon can still be resurrected on the day his spirit is strongest, the WINTER SOLSTICE! Link must go out, power up the triforce from 6 temples, and then defeat Ganon’s shadow once and for all!</p>

<p>It’s a complete rework hack. The graphics are changed a lot, including giving Link a cute hood, but the main change is the layouts. It follows the same GENERAL ideas, though you get items and upgrades in a different order. Also, you start the game with 3 bars of health and 1 bar of magic. Yeah, that’s what I mean when I say this game is a little unfair and mean, right off the bat. Zelda 2 is actually pretty easy at the start, it eases you in, lets you get used to things, build up a small amount of spells, then it kicks you in the dick with Death Mountain. THIS game has Death Mountain literally RIGHT AT THE START. It’s the first thing you do, after getting shield. And it’s TWO TIMES AS LONG. I called it Deather Mountain. So yea, you’re fighting Dairas at like, level 1, trying to find your way to the first temple. With less health and magic than usual.</p>

<p>The bullshit doesn’t stop there. A lot of the level design is built SPECIFICALLY to be rude and mean. Lots of hard battles of crumbling bridges, lots of bubbles to knock you in pits, lots of Dairas. And since everything is new, you don’t know where to go to get your upgrades, so it took me FOREVER to get Life. Some things are VERY well hidden.</p>

<p>Another thing is that the map is too big. Like, its the same size as the normal zelda 2 map, but the way it’s set up is that to get from one area to the next, you need to travel through large spots with no path, so a bunch of random encounters, and several caves. Then you get to the spot you need to be at and explore, die cause oh shit every encounter has a blue daira, and then walk aaaalll the way back. There ARE shortcuts you can find, which help, but they’re barely helpful, and require you to usually beat an area first. Some areas are fucking HUGE. Maze Island is a NIGHTMARE. One thing that this has going for it is every temple has you start in the temple when you die, like the Great Palace does in vanilla Zelda 2. This is SUPER helpful, and the game would be impossible without it.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/NRDRzN2.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Is it bad? Well no, it’s Zelda 2. But like I said, Zelda 2 is both fun, and ramps up the difficulty rather well. This game is a wall, then a plateau after you get a lot of items (though it’s still hard), theeen you get to the final dungeon. Which… wow.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/hPAYVOc.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>This is Thunder Bird. In Zelda 2, he’s by far the hardest boss. His attacks are erratic and hard to dodge, he attacks all the time, and his pattern is wavy and hard to follow, especially when you’re dodging a bullet hell. You also need to use thunder to make him vulnerable, which, okay. You still have enough to cast shield and jump, which are basically required. How can we make this harder? How about we make it surrounded by water, so if you’re hit once, you’re prolly going in the drink and dying instantly. Okay, that’s pretty bad… but let’s make it worse. No spells. At all. Other than Thunder. No heal, no shield, and CERTAINLy no Jump. And this is at the end of a dungeon, so you prolly have like, 1.5 lives left.</p>

<p>This drove me up the wall. I was willing to ignore all of the earlier mean and bad design as just challenge that wasn’t QUITE for me but was still good, but no. This actually sucked. I could not stand it.</p>

<p>In the end, I wish I could, but I can’t recommend this hack. But if you’re like, a speedrunner of Zelda 2, MAYBE you’ll get more enjoyment out of it. Again, a lot of my friends loved it… but they were also all speedrunners lol. Ah well… This kind of killed my desire to play Zelda 2. I’ll try more hacks at some point, but… not for a while ):</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="NES" /><category term="retro games" /><category term="Zelda" /><category term="hacks" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 83</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/29/OOCY83.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 83" /><published>2024-12-29T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-12-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/29/OOCY83</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/29/OOCY83.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/7uKwnKh.png" alt="&quot;This book is a Mata x Hari x Gudako book.

<p>So, NES RPGs, huh? I’ve been playing a lot of them recently. There’s a lot of really popular ones out there, like Mother, Final Fantasy, the Dragon Quest series… but what about the more obscure ones? Like, ones that didn’t come out over here? So continuing my NES RPG dive, I decided to check out this game, Lagrange Point, a prety obscure late-era NES Konami RPG. Although, there MAY be some of you who HAVE heard of this game… It has one thing that really, really sets it apart from everything else. Let’s talk about the VRC7 to start.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/drwX7MbB_IE?si=7MN9WyT3egN3hEar" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>So, most NES games use a 4-channel chiptune sound system, right? I don’t know EXACTLY how that works, I’m not a sound engineer, but I get the general idea. And also, most NES games use mappers, right? These are chips that go on the cart that change the specs of the system, giving more video ram and other such things. What if we put them together…? Well, we get some mappers that also change the music/sound capabilities of the NES, most notably in Konami’s own Castlevania 3. The Japanese version of the game used the VRC6 chip, which allowed things like bank switching and gave three additional sound channels. It really helps make a fuller sound. Gimmick also had something similar, again, only in Japan. Konami wasn’t done, however, and invented the VRC7 chip. In addition to its usual mapper capabilities, the VRC7  produces 6 channels of 2-operator FM Synthesis audio. Now, what does that mean? Well, it’ll make more sense if I say it’s basically a slightly cut up Yamaha YM2413, which was the sound chip used on the Master System and the MSX. Instead of the 9 channels of the normal chip, this one produces 6. Which is still more than the 4 the NES can usually produce. And on top of that, it’s SYNTH, not chip tune, so it produeces a COMPLETELY unique sound.</p>

<p>This game is the ONLY game that uses the VRC7 in this way. The chip was also in Tiny Toon Adventures 2, but was never used for music, just its usual Mapper stuff, so this is the only NES game with synthesis audio. This music has more in common with the Genesis than it does NES, or even SNES. It is EXTREMELy unique, and the music itself is really damn good, too. If this game is known for anything, it’s that. That’s its main claim to fame. And most people just listen to the OST and leave it at that, but I wanted to know what the game’s actual deal was. So I dove in.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/b0keVAO.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Lagrange Point is a pretty typical JRPG in a sci-fi setting. It’s quite similar in vibes to Phantasy Star. Taking place on a space station set up in the Lagrange Point, the point of gravitational equilibrium between the moon and the earth, you play as Gene, a young pilot who works for a rescue team who are sent to the station after things go silent. Turns out, a coup has taken place. Basically, there was a doctor who determined that human-caused climate change was going to make the planet entirely unlivable within the next several years. He decided that the only way to save the Human race was to use bio-engineering and mutagents to mutate them into a higher form of being. Okay, that makes sense so far. …aaand then he declares himself The Bio Kaiser and sets up a violent fascist regime, killing everyone who isn’t loyal to him and trying to rule space and the Earth. Okay, you lost me. I don’t really see why that second part needed to happen, doc, you could have just tried to help people instead. But what do I know?</p>

<p>You’re one of the only survivors of your squad, and now you join the resistance to stop the Bio Kaiser. Along the way you’ll do chores and help out the different cities and people on this station, until finally you confront the Kaiser himself and take him out, thus saving the day. Uh, I guess we’ll forget the “the world is ending” thing. That’s not important.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/3YeoxiV.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>The story isn’t super interesting, though it has some little moments that really stand out. It feels kind of like a step between NES and SNES RPGs, where the story doesn’t really matter and it’s about the big adventure and exploring, but we also get a few cutscenes and characters that really set the tone. There’s a guy who hounds you the entire time, that feels more SNES-y than NES-y. And most notably, there’s a scene where one of the Bio Kaiser’s head generals violently slices a child apart on screen and you see him bleed out and the light goes from his eyes. That is not a fucking joke. It’s EXTREMELY dark and it comes out of mother fucking nowhere. He’s like, 4 or 5, too. It’s kinda fucked.</p>

<p>While Lagrange Point is rather typical JRPG fare, it has some things that set it apart from the crowd, some really unique ideas. You’ve got typical JRPG combat and gating your progress by different vehicles that you get licenses for, but the game also has a crafting system! Basically, there’s six elements, and combining two elements together will produce a weapon of a certain element. There’s a table you need to follow. And if these weapons are of the same level, the resultign weapon will be one level higher. So combining two level 1 weapons will produce a level 2 one. This is fine at first, buuuut, no rank 3 and above weapons are for sale in the game. Which means, to get a rank 3, you need 2 rank 2s you can buy. But to get a rank 4, you buy 4. For a rank 5, 8, And for the rank 6 weapons, which you’ll NEED to deck your party out with, you need to buy 16 fucking weapons. With a limited inventory. And you need them for all your party.</p>

<p>Not every party member can use them, though. You have a rather large cast of character, none of whom are super interesting, but they all have their quirks. Unique super abilities, unique spells they can cast (called kits here), and notably, some are robots. Robots use a unique weapon and armor system, so they’re easier to maintain. But they ALSO fall off way faster, as their rank 6 weapons are nowhere near as effective as non-robots.</p>

<p>Another unique system is the hype system. If the battle is “going well”, a character can get hype, increasing their chance to hit and critical hits. If its going bad, they can get nervous, which does the opposite. Unfortunately, there’s also characters who can get scared instead, which means they CAN’T attack. And the “going well” vs “going bad” thing is completely arbitrary. I walk outside and get into one battle, and they’re scared. This makes them unusable. Which sucks, cause this game has two women, and one of them is this character. You meet her and she’s like “ah, I’m a sexy badass resistance soldier. Alright boys, I GUESS you can join me, if you don’t mind being carried by a girl~” and then you get into one fucking fight and she goes “AAGH, A SPIDER!” and throws her weapon to the god damn ground. I mostly found the mechanic annoying. It adds nothing and takes away too much.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/cpb4xL4.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>The combat is pretty typical, though the enemy sprites are absolutely nuts. Weird-ass mutant designs, I love it. Here’s the Child Murderer, by the way. You can attack, use your kit techs, or use a super, if the character has a super (some have none). Gene’s supers are absolutely busted, doing massive damage to all enemies, though it takes health to use them. This is still really fast and good for grinding, kinda trivializing a lot of combat. Also, the game has a BP system. The best way I can describe it is it’s your mana, and everything uses it, except supers. Tech kits to heal? Yep. Tech kits to hurt? Also yep. Just basic attacking? Yepperoonie. If you run out, you’ll punch instead of fire your gun/swing your sword, which does basically nothing. You can buy new upgrades at stores, but keeping BP refills on hand is a good idea.</p>

<p>And that’s basically Lagrange Point. It’s got some cool settings and vibes, but over all is just pretty okay. 7/10. It has just a few too many mechanics that I found kind of annoying, or found to be literal busywork to pad the time. But it’s at least interesting, and the music of course is utterly fantastic.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="NES" /><category term="retro games" /><category term="obscure games" /><category term="Lagrange Point" /><category term="RPG" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 82</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/28/OOCY82.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 82" /><published>2024-12-28T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-12-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/28/OOCY82</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/28/OOCY82.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/K8U3l9u.png" alt="&quot;This is bad.

<p>So recently I mastered Zelda 2 on the NES. In order to master that set I had to play the game four times. What do you do after spending so much time beating a game four times? BEAT IT MORE TIMES. Yes, for some god damn reason, I felt like mastering ANOTHER version of Zelda 2.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ynqbaIl.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>This is the NES Classics series, a special series of games released on GBA which are basically just emulated versions of classic NES games. There were 30 games released, though in North America and Europe we only got 12 games. Many of these are black box games, but you have some other classics in there, too. The list is as follows: Donkey Kong, Excitebike, Ice Climber, Zelda, SMB, Dr. Mabio, Metroid, Zelda 2, Bomberman, Pac-man, Xevious, and Castlevania. This is honestly a pretty good cast of games. Japan got a lot of the other black box games, and a few other classics like Kid Icarus, SMB2 (lost levels), Mappy, and Ghosts n Goblins.</p>

<p>These are pretty accurately emulated. There was actually a lot of emulation going on with the GBA. It could emulate the NES, and it could ALSO emulate the original Gameboy and Gameboy Color. Yes, emulate. Not like, actual hardware, emulation.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/LE8Fu3J.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>The main issue is that the aspect ratio of the GBA is a little funky, so the game looks weird, AND the colors that the GBA can display aren’t QUITE right. This was mostly noticable because I had literally just played the NES version. A few sounds are also off, not bad but noticably a little off. But other than that, it’s pretty surpisingly accurate. And… yeah, that’s it. It’s Zelda 2. This time I only had to play it twice! How exciting. I don’t have much more to add about Zelda 2. It’s damn good.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="GBA" /><category term="retro games" /><category term="Zelda" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 81</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/26/OOCY81.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 81" /><published>2024-12-26T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-12-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/26/OOCY81</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/26/OOCY81.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/hQ9yZg5.png" alt="&quot;Bend over a little.

<p>So I’ve played Dragon Quest 1 many, many times. I DID pick up and look at DQ2, 3, and 4 a few times, but I never got super into them. That finally changed recently, with me finishing Dragon Quest 2, and now 3. And of all of them, DQ3 was the one that interested me the most, for all these years, for several reasons.</p>

<p>First, this game is a HUGE upgrade from DQ1 and 2 in so many ways. DQ1 was a large game for its time, with a giant sprawling world you had to explore, with many towns and dungeons and caves. This was compounded in the sequel, which practically doubles the size of the world, gives you a ship, and allows you to explore around, INCLUDING on the old game’s world map. How can they match that for Dragon Quest 3? By doing it again. DQ3 is fucking HUGE. And its one of the first RPGs I can think of that does the bait and switch “Whoop, here’s a second world map!” twist at what you THINK is the end. Final Fantasy 3 KINDA did it, but it feels a bit less large than it does here. And in FF3, it’s like “oh we’re already out of places to explore, and we’re not even that far in the game. Oh snap, it’s a floating island!” In DQ3, you’re told to fight Satan, you go on a LOT of adventures through this GIANT map, kill Satan, then learn OH SHIT THERE’S SATAN 2, THE BOSS OF SATAN, GO TO HIS WORLD, ANOTHER GIANT WORLD MAP, TO STOP HIM. That’s nuts. For this era, that is NUTS.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/XwxJpPc.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>The second thing that interested me as a kid, and still today, is the game’s party system. In DQ1, you had one character. In 2, you had three characters who were all like, characters. In this one, you name your hero, and then get to build a party out of randos at the local bar. They each have their own classes, so you can build a team of 3 randos that you name and concept, from about 6 classes. That’s pretty rad, and creates cool replayability value. And especially when you get reclassing later, so you can make soldiers with spells and stuff, if you wanted to. This game ALSO allows you to choose the GENDER of your characters. Which is absolutely stunningly ahead of its time. Confusingly though, the dialogue does NOT change if you make your main character a girl.</p>

<p>If you’re female, every character refers to you as a man. Except for two. There’s a kid who’s like “Hey, you’re the legendary hero! Wait, you’re a girl!” and then your dad who finds you in the final dungeon, and doesn’t recognize you, telling you to go to his daughter in your hometown, and let her know of his passing. This implies to me that your main character is, in fact, cross dressing. Which is fucking hilarious. Only your mom, dad, and some random kid notice. Mulana the RPG. It’s never really explained though, so it feels confusing when you first pick it up, like “But I chose girl though…”</p>

<p>Other than that, it is Dragon Quest, though it feels a lot more concise and… dare I say, pleasant this time around. Yes, there’s still grinding, but all of the puzzles and dungeons and things you do feel better telegraphed than hearing one dude in a random town go “Oh there’s one tile in a swamp you need to check, good luck”. And like I said, it’s huge. Hyuuuuuuggggeee. This game blew me away, honestly.</p>

<p>The story is also exciting and fun for an NES RPG, especially as a fan of DQ1 and 2. It looks like it’s disconnected at first, with a completely new world map. But then with that plot twist you find out this is a PREQUEL, as you go to Alefgard, the location of the first game, and see how different it was hundreds of years prior.</p>

<p>One other fun thing about the game though, is that I played this not long after the Switch remake, and I was finding it difficult to find good information online about the original. Also, what the hell is with new Dragon Quest’s magic translation? The ice spells are Crack now? WTF does Kazam and Kafrizzle do?? Or how about Swooshmurta? Yeah, I know people shit post about the NES DQ translations, but I actually kinda prefer it. ESPECIALLY because, in your world, the first world map, everyone talks… normally. It’s only in the fantasy Alefgard world that they speaketh liketh thiseth. It’s also really kinda neat, cause in Dragon Quest 1, when you find the tablet from Erdrick, it DOESN’T speak like that. There’s a reason. Erdrick was from a world where they just… don’t speak like that. That’s a cute detail.</p>

<p>DQ3 is by far the stand out of the Erdrick trilogy, and a shining jewel of an RPG on the console. It can be mean, very mean, with some of its bosses, and I DID need to grind to stand a chance at the end, but I didn’t really mind much. A very fun time I’d recommend.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="NES" /><category term="retro games" /><category term="Dragon Quest" /><category term="RPG" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 79</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/24/OOCY79.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 79" /><published>2024-12-24T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-12-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/24/OOCY79</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/24/OOCY79.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/LK8LZVQ.png" alt="&quot;All of this, it really is just some game to you.&quot; While kabadoning a girl who looks like she is having a LOT of fun." class="center-block" /></p>
