<p>I think no game grew on me more over the course of my playing it than Golfaria. When I first played Golfaria, I really didn’t like it. I played it more, and realized I kiiind of hated it? It was in D tier in my first tier list. But the entire time I was playing it, I was like “there’s something I’d love in here, something extremely fun and creative, it’s just REALLY hard to get to that point”. But when you FINALLY do, yeah. Yeah it’s fun and creative.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/PpJ36Hk.png" alt="Golfaria" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Golfaria is a top down Metroidvania-esque game, though I’d honestly liken it more to Zelda than to Metroid. It’s an action adventure game, where you play as a golf ball, awakening deep in the earth after who knows how long, with no memories, that you know of. You enter the world of Fairway, a beautiful realm, filled with sentient golf balls, horrible bugs called “Bogies”, birdies and eagles, and robo-birds that watch your every move and give you lore when you destroy them. What’s your goal? You don’t know. Just… go exploring.</p>

<p>The only problem is that exploring is awful, and is not fun to do, at all, when you first start. The game is a top down golf game, think something like Kirby’s Dream Course though not quite that advanced. You can only hit the ball forward, no smacking it up into the air, unless you’re in sand or a hole. You have only a certain number of strikes to get the ball to where you want to go, and again, it’s the start of the game. You don’t know where you want to go, yet. With only 20 strokes you need to go exploring. Those strokes can be improved by finding golf clubs, though good luck finding those, and healed by hitting birds, killing bogies, and finding safe zone flags, but good luck finding those, too. The game DOES kind of lead you in the right direction for a good upgrade to help make things easier, but it still took more percise suggestions to get there for me.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/zHxmpt9.png" alt="Golfaria" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Once you get past that hurdle though, and go through the first few dungeony areas with a few more clubs to increase your health, the game opens up in a way that’s really nice. The game controls really roughly at first, and you fly all over the god damn place, but once you get the brakes, holy shit it controls so much better. I do like the aesthetics and graphical design, but holy fuck it’s hard to tell which way slopes go sometimes, so you go all over which way. You can figure it out by studying the map with A, which shows you the direction of slopes, but it took me a bit to learn that.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Golfaria is a land of contrasts. As I knew, there’s a lot of fun to be had here, and I really did enjoy exploring it all to find 100% of the items. But it takes a bit to get there. Just be patient, don’t be like me.</p>

<p>Here it is. The big one. This is the most influential game in the entire catalogue. Campanella would be their big breakthrough hit, possibly saving the company from bankruptcy, and influencing a complete brand change, as by the following year, they’d have changed their name from LX Systems to “UFO Soft”. But for now, this is still an LX Systems game.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/jJYqCb0.png" alt="Campanella" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Campanella is a continuation of Zoldath. Kinda. Meesha Danry is credited as having the idea to bring the pilot and little red UFO back from Zoldath, thus saving the company’s most iconic characters. The game is a… platformer, kind of?? You control the little UFO, which will fall with the force of gravity. You can hold A to boost yourself upwards, so it’s kinda like a sort of swimming control. It’s very, VERY smooth, and controls extremely well. While you’re burning fuel, however, you’re uh, burning fuel. Run out, and you’ll crash to the ground. To keep this from happening, you need to defeat enemies, break blocks, and collect orbs, which increase your fuel. One hit from anything, including walls, will kill you, so you need to be careful as you fly around, but the crux of the game is that you gain lives REALLY easily just from score, so it becomes a gamble of “how risky do I get to get a high score, which will keep me playing?”</p>

<p>Campanella was made by Petter and his team of Gregory Milk, Chiffon Bola, and Shayn North, and they all did a fantastic job. The game looks amazing, it kinda reminds me of Gimmick aesthetically. It also sounds great, music by Petter himself. That 2nd world music is FANTASTIC.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/vnndcID.png" alt="Campanella" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Another fun thing about the game is that it introduces a 100% category involving coffee. Once again, coffee makes its appearance as little collectibles. You fly around a level, and if you fly into a certain spot in each level, coffee will spawn elsewhere and you can collect it. Get it all for the 100% ending. How do you FIND the coffee? Sometimes it’s just about randomly, but usually you can get an idea, just by looking at what areas of the map would be useless to go to. Getting all the Coffee makes the game a little easier, IMO, because you get so many lives just from the 500 points the coffee gives you.</p>

<p>Campanella was the breakout hit that LX Systems needed, and deserved. And while it is not my personal favorite game of their’s so far, or even IMO the best (I’d put Magic Garden, Kick Club, and Camouflage above it), it is extremely enjoyable, and worth a play.</p>

<p>This was the second game I finished, which look longer and more brain power than Magic Garden. I 100%’d it in a single sitting, which is a good sign.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/eSpcV7G.png" alt="Camouflage" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Camouflage is a unique puzzle game, where you play as a lizard. The gods of this world, the sun and the raincloud, believe you have it too easy, and cannot evolve this way, and so they introduce hazards to your environment. But to make things fair, they give you a gift: The ability to change your color, so you can blend into the world around you!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/gKclsaV.png" alt="Camouflage" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Each level of Camouflage drops you into a world of differnet colored backgrounds. You can press B to shift to the color of that background, which allows you to avoid the sight of any enemies while on that background. You can press A to see where enemies can see, which is massively helpful. Your goal is to escape to the exit, maybe while also grabbing all the extra collectables along the way. There’s two oranges and a baby on every level, and the baby basically makes you 2x as long, which makes puzzle solving to escape all the more complicated.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/xMOSfZ0.png" alt="Camouflage" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>The game is a lot of pattern recognition, and when the alligators come into play, some light action, because while the frogs are basically sentries you must avoid, the gators are always on the move, as sentries, so some puzzles involve using them as cover from frogs and whatnot. The game is extremely interesting and fun the entire way through, nothing challenging, but a nice brain tickler, lots of “Aha, THERE’S the way through” moments.</p>

<p>It’s also got a cute backstory to it. Gerry Smolski’s mother made a children’s book that went unpublished, we all know what that’s like tbh, so they made it into a game. This game does have very “children’s fable” energy to it, ESPECIALLY with the ending, which I will not spoil. It’s a really good one, highly recommended.</p>

<p>My first mastery since Cohost closed, and also my first mastery in two weeks, since I went so extremely hard on UFO 50. But I’m back. It’s the spoop month, so what better month to work on some spoopy games?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/QKNTdRe.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Soul Void Redux is a remaster of a sort of the game Soul Void, a free homebrew horror Gameboy game by artist Kadabura. It’s a bit of a walking simulator, with only EXTREMELY light gameplay beyond walking around and talking to things. I’m talkin’ avoiding enemies that walk across the screen in simple patterns in like, 3 different screens simple. It’s not about the gameplay. To me, this game is art more than a game. It’s about the art, the style, and the emotions that it can bring out with its story and dialogue.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/d5LwlWw.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Soul Void is a psychological horror game. You play an unnamed character, only referred to as “Girlie” or “Outsider” by others. You have fallen to somewhere called the void, where lost souls go instead of moving on to the next part in their journey. No one knows why, but they’re stuck here, and as they last longer and longer here, their anxieties, worries, and fears begin to eat away at them, and they start to lose themselves to it. The game is about those anxieties and fears, and how they are not the end, and they don’t have to control us.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/bxP3X2d.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>You play a character who you see very little insight into, except for a few things that show that she is mentally not okay, and is extremely depressed, anxiety ridden, and barely able to function, and yet she takes time out of her day to help others instead of herself. And that’s what you do. You travel this world, finding people in varying stages of body horror as they devolve into their base emotions and fears, and you try to help them through it. You find a being who’s created a “factory”, because if they’re not doing something or working hard, SOMETHING is wrong, and they WILL explode. Of course, that’s not true, and they know it, but it’s the only way to keep them from freaking out. You need to help them walk away.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/JdI5QXf.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" />
<img src="https://imgur.com/JpNywOC.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>While the game is extremely dark, as it explores and discusses the most dark things that we can do in our psychosis, it is also very optimistic and warm, in that it’s about overcoming those things, and moving past them. Helping ourselves, as well as others. It’s extremely good. And the art is FANTASTIC. I really can’t stress that enough. The art is dark but beautiful, and very interesting. It is, of course, horror. Body horror is everywhere. But it’s intriguing in its morbidity. And the music is quite good too, very dark and fitting. Almost industrtial, in parts, coming out of my gamed boy.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/5eypwEQ.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Soul Void is a game that kind of wears its influences on its sleeve. Literally, there is a room that is just references to games the creator likes and is influenced by. Which is cool! Does it deserve to stand alongside these greats like Off, Undertale, and Yume Niki? I mean, I thought it was extremely good, and for a free game, it’s worth your time. It’s not long, so if you’ve got an hour or two to spend, it might make you think for a bit about how you handle yourself. Also the dialogue is quite good and shockingly funny at points, for a game about suicidal anxiety ridden people.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Homebrew" /><category term="Gameboy" /><category term="Soul Void" /><category term="Walking Sims" /><category term="Horror" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">UFO 50 Retrospective Part 15 - Block Koala</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/reviews/2024/10/12/UFO50-15.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="UFO 50 Retrospective Part 15 - Block Koala" /><published>2024-10-12T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-10-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/reviews/2024/10/12/UFO50#15</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/reviews/2024/10/12/UFO50-15.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/IHT4K7Z.png" alt="Koala" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>I don’t think any game fell for me harder than Block Koala.</p>

<p>When I first opened Block Koala, I was ecstatic! It’s a sokoban game! I love sokoban! Unfortunately, it seems I forgot the unfortunate truth. Not every sokoban game is Void Stranger. Most are not.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/wnPSr0K.png" alt="Koala" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>This is a pretty standard sokoban title, with the twist of a few unique mechanics. Basically, blocks are weighted, and they can only push other blocks if they’re of a greater or equal weight. You can push blocks onto one blocks to add to them, which will help you push heavier blocks you need out of the way. There are a few other unique mechanics down the way too, like a clone movement guy, and blue blocks that can ONLY be pushed by other blocks, but other than that, pretty bog standard.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Blhej7N.png" alt="Koala" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>If there’s not much in terms of mechanics, a sokoban title lives or dies on its good level design. And the level design here is… okay. It’s okay. Not very interesting. And there’s SO MUCH OF IT. This is one of the longest games in the entire collection, at a whopping FIFTY levels. I liked it for the first ten or so and the last 40 were honestly mostly boring. A LOT of what the levels are is what I call “big loops”, where you just loop shit around over and over. It’s a common sokoban thing but it doesn’t GOTTA be. Y’know, Void Stranger.</p>

<p>I might be a little spoiled by Void Stranger being so good.</p>

<p>It feels soooo long by the end. A video of perfect level clears and nothing else is an hour and twenty minutes, so you can guess how long it’d take someone to beat it trying to actually solve the damn puzzles.</p>

<p>It’s cute and charming, sure. The weight mechanic is kinda interesting but honestly a little confusing at first, it takes trial and error to learn how it works, cause y’know, no manuals or in game instructions. And it has a level editor feature which is real impressive for this era, but eh, I can’t be bothered.</p>

<p>One of the more interesting things about this game is the backstory that LX Systems is STILL trying desperately to get people interested in their games in other ways. There was a level design contest for this, which is pretty neat.</p>

<p>One new staff member for this one, Lanila Baler, who’s brought on for additional graphics staff. The office is quite packed. Also, I forgot to mention Joy Akebi joined for Avianos, which is wild cause she’s one of my favorite members of staff, so I went back and fixed that.</p>

<p>So, LX Systems has made 13 games now, and uh, it’s not going amazingly. They’re losing money, and with having to hire more and more staff, it’s catching up. They’re trying to do more unconventional methods of advertisement, like with this game, where they put on a tournament at a local bar to drum up excitement. This bar, and the winner, are credited in this game. I like that idea, it’s a cool idea, though I wish they had done it for a more interesting game. This is also one of the first games where Chiffon Bola took a more important role, as the lead gameplay designer, but like… it all kinda falls flat for me.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/QDS7cPX.png" alt="Bushido" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Bushido Ball is a sports game, the first true sports game of the company, and I don’t really like those much, but they CAN be good. And this is clearly inspired by one of the best ones ever: Windjammers. The game is a pong-like sports game, where a ball is in the middle, and you control a person running around. You need to hit the ball with your weapon to try and get it past the opponent. After hitting the ball twice, you gain half a meter. This meter can be used for a special move by double tapping attack, or for a full charge hit by holding A, using up a whole meter bar.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/baCiTLd.png" alt="Bushido" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>It’s also worth noting on top of VS, it also has co-op, to become a kind of doubles tennis game, which is neat, but I have no friends, so I can’t experience it.</p>

<p>There’s really not much more to it than that, to be honest. Like, there’s no sound or music during the game, except for when a player wins a round, a little jingle plays. The art is really nice, and I like the different character designs. They’re all varied, and have unique abilities that seem quite balanced. And like I said, Windjammers is king, but it’s too slow and clunky compared to Windjammers, which is smooth and exciting and FUN. This is just a bit boring. It’s not bad conceptually, but I just find I don’t care about it, at all.</p>

<p>Sorry, Chiffon ):</p>

<p>It is 1985, and while it’s important to note that Thorson Petters has worked at the company the entire time since he originally made Barbuta in 1982, he has not really headed a project SINCE then. He’s made all of the music and sounds for the past 11 games, but never has he directed his own specific game, since Barbuta. Why is that? Well, this game is the answer. Mooncats is the spiritual sequel to Barbuta, and Petters has been working on it for the past two years. The game has no credits, it kicks you right back to the menu after you beat it, so I assume Petters made it ENTIRELY by himself. Once again, Petters shows himself to be the Artist of the group, the weird one who created the weirdest god damn things. Like this.</p>

<p>Also, outside of the meta narrative of UFO 50, this game is one of those games that was released as something else before being put here. This game was made by Eirik Suhrke, the musician for UFO 50, in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 34. It was called “..and the mooncats”, and it got 8th place. I don’t know Mr. Suhrke, or anything about him other than that he solo made this, Barbuta, and all the music, so I imagine he’s a bit of an IRL Thorson Petters.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/WJn98Fy.png" alt="Mooncat" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>When I first saw the next game I had to play was called “Mooncat”, I was really excited, because I like cats, and I like the moon. Put em together! What greets you when you start the game is a weird little spotted sausage on legs, and the most CONFOUNDING controls you’ll ever experience. You’re floated into the first area, and with no prior knowledge, will press the D-pad to the right. This makes you walk left. You press the d-pad left. This ALSO makes you walk left. You try another button, pressing A. This makes you walk to the right.</p>

<p>Mooncat is like a video game from another universe, and not even the universe all the other UFO 50 games are from. Its controls are like nothing else I’ve ever experienced, like a universe where the d-pad was never invented. It’s extremely interesting. Mooncat is a two button videogame. And to simulate that, the entire d-pad is one button, and A and B are the other button. So you can just play it by pressing up and A for the entire thing. The left button makes you move left, the right button makes you move right. When you press them together, you jump, in the direction of the first button you were pressing when you pressed both together. You can press then together again in mid air to do a ground pound to hit enemies and bounce, or to drop through platforms. You can double tap a direction to roll and dash for a little bit.</p>

<p>Your goal is that you’re plopped into a level. Platform through it. You have your traditional exit through each level, but levels might have secret hidden portals as well. These can be found by looking for flowers, which will hint that a portal is nearby, or just looking for any platforms and paths that look out of the way and hard to reach.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/jsrloGx.png" alt="Mooncat" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>There are a few other little tricks. You can bounce some enemies to other locations with ground pounds. Jumping over a skull on the ground can cause secret platforms to appear. Stuff like that. There are three endings you can reach, by going through different portals. They’re not difficult to find, per-se, but the exploration is part of the fun.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/UYPwwFC.png" alt="Mooncat" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>The other part of the fun is how god damn weird this game is. Nothing is explained. You press start, you’re thrown into it. What you are is not explained. What you do is not explained. Nothing is explained. You see yourself as a weird fetus at one point, and you’re going out hunting for eggs, which contain random things, like slime, a reference to Barbuta, or a red mantis, which will appear in later LX Systems games down the line. If you’re supposed to be like, a newborn baby, this game is BRILLIANT, because it fucking feels like it. Trying to learn how to control it is difficult, but you get your footing little by little, until you’re doing some complex platforming. The platforming is never like, fucked. It’s less than Mario 1. But it’s complex for a newborn, which is what you are.</p>

<p>This game was fucking weird as hell, but that is its charm, and it really grew on me. I think it succeeded in its mission extremely well. Just don’t ask me to explain the Lore of the Barbuta-verse to you.</p>
