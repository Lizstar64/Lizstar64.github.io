It’s time to bring them here. So here you go. My yuri recommendations. This will need to be updated sometime, and I will. When that happens, I’ll repost it.</p>

<p><strong><em>PART 1: FINISHED WORKS</em></strong></p>

<hr />

<p>Every damn day before I go to bed, I lay in bed and read yuri until I fall asleep. And then I post cute little snippits from it (or really dumb snippits from it) onto this website for your enjoyment. And I get a lot of people who go “Liz, as the world’s leading yuri sommelier, what would you recommend?”</p>

<p>And I always say just ask and I’ll give you a yuri or two to tide you over, but someone suggested I just put that shit in a post SO I’MMA PUT THAT SHIT IN A POST</p>

<p>The following is a list of manga that I recommend, alongside a brief description and anything that might be controversial or content warningy. If you like any of these, let me know whatcha think, and consider supporting the artists and writers! You can often find a way to do that on the website I’m linking.</p>

<p>Also, this is not NEARLY a list of EVERYTHING I’d recommend, and I may add to it in the future. I’m also avoiding yuri that’s not finished or finished being translated, so there’s a LOT of amazing ones that I don’t want to get you into and then have you be sad when it never finishes getting translated. If you all like this enough, I might do another one where I recommend a bunch of yuri that’s still being worked on. I might also do another post down the line about oneshots I really like. This is ENTIRELY series.</p>

<p>Anyways, bring on the cute girls!</p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em><a href="https://dynasty-scans.com/authors/nagori_yu">Yuki and the Authoress</a></em></strong></p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/kF4S3vO.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Warnings: Age gap (both adults), parental abuse</p>

<p>This is a historical story taking place either in the late Meiji era or early Taisho. Yuki is a young lower class woman working at a cafe frequented by upper class society. She’s a quiet and shy girl who lives her life between work and her books, her favorite of which are by the fluffy romance author, Azuma Beniko. So when Azuma Sensei shows up in her cafe, it overwhelms her. And then Azuma says that she wants to use Yuki as reference for her new novel…</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/krSflRf.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Read this if you like: Extreme fluff, light drama, hot women playing with soft shy women.</p>

<p>If you like this, you should read: Literally anything else written by the author, Nagori Yu. She has a type, is what I’m saying. This is, to my belief, the only thing she has ever actually FINISHED, but all of her unfinished manga that’s halfway through has this dynamic of hot powerful woman and shy cute woman.</p>

<hr />
<p><a href="https://dynasty-scans.com/series/even_if_it_was_just_once_i_regret_it">Even If It Was Just Once, I Regret It</a>
***</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/IwUz5ve.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Warnings: Oh boy, a lot. Age Gap (both adults), starts with sexual assault, power imbalance dynamics, light ecchi</p>

<p>Okay now listen, when I describe the conceit of this manga to you, you are not gonna like the sound of it. This is the hardest manga to recommend but it’s also one of my favorites, okay? Here we go.</p>

<p>Koduka-san is a game dev who has recently gotten fired from her job. She’s drowning her sorrows in alcohol, and is unable to function or pay rent. Her landlord (the manga CALLS her a landlord, and Miss Landlord, but she’s really more of a person who works at the apartment complex managing it and working with the occupants, she does not own the building) comes by to check up on her and gives her an offer on how to keep living there. The offer, at least through Koduka’s drunk haze, seems to be “sleep with me, and you can stay here”. So Koduka does.</p>

<p>Once she awakens, she immediately regrets it, and Miss Landlord gives her another offer. She can stay there with her, and if Koduka “services” her, she will consider the debt repaid.</p>

<p>Now I know how this sounds. It sounds fucking horrible. But trust me, this is actually a REALLY good manga. It’s light and fluffy, but is built on MASSIVE misunderstandings that will eventually give way to almost slice of life pleasantness as these two live together and grow closer.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/IbmrqFA.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Read this manga if you like: Lots of fluff and can put up with a bit to get there, enjoy seeing “straight” girls realize “oh shit wait why DID I immediately jump to having sex with her”, idiot couples, medium levels of drama</p>

<hr />
<p><a href="https://dynasty-scans.com/series/after_school">After School</a>
***</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/i5rGE6z.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Warnings: School girls in high school, lightly echii. Nothing explicit, but they are REALLY makin’ out.</p>

<p>Shiine and Ichika aren’t quite friends. Barely even acquaintances. They know of each other, as the other… fascinates them in a way they can’t explain, but they never had a chance to interact. However, at the start of the school year, they’re both selected as class representatives, and thus work together on the student council. After Ichika is late to a meeting, Shiine offers to help tell her what she missed, and they begin to talk to get to know each other… and the conversation goes to kissing.</p>

<p>Ichika assumes Shiine has dated and kissed COUNTLESS boys, after all, she’s so hot and cool. Shiine hasn’t but feels embarassed and embraces the lie. So Ichika wants to know… what is it like to kiss…?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/pg1JuX8.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Once the two start… they fall into a routine. Once a week, sometimes even two or three times a week, after school, the two meet up and kiss each other. They’re less than friends, but also more than friends. Kissing friends. Can they move past how they feel and become something even more?</p>

<p>Read this manga if you like: EXTREME LEVELS OF FLUFF. OVERLOAD. OVERLOAD. Girls making out with girls. Idiot couple, like holy shit REALLY BIG IDIOT COUPLE ENERGY. “THIS GIRL KEEPS ASKING ME TO MAKE OUT WITH HER EVERY DAY AFTER SCHOOL I WONDER IF SHE LIKES ME LIKE I LIKE HER”</p>

<hr />
<p><a href="https://dynasty-scans.com/series/lily_love">Lily Love</a>
***</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/hNCh9Lt.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Warnings: Light to medium drama. Abusive relationships, stalking. Homophobic and abusive fathers.</p>

<p>This one is Thai, so if you read it and think the vibe is different, it very much is! And so are the names. Trust me, these are the character’s actual names in the story. This isn’t some mistranslation.</p>

<p>Donut is a young girl who is just entering college. She’s nerdy, not conventionally attractive, and has never really experienced love. One day she runs into an older student at the dorm washing machine, a cool lady named Mew. Mew is friendly, and maybe a little… flirty? No, that couldn’t be, they’re both girls! The two hit it off as friends, and find out they’re actually neighbors! What a coincidence!</p>

<p>This is a story of their friendship as it grows into something more!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/L9skYI9.png" alt="yuri" />
<img src="https://imgur.com/UjMu2eG.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Read this if you like: Girls who are more experienced picking up “straight” girls. Simple concepts. This one doesn’t have some major grand arching plot, except for some stuff involving an ex. It’s not OVERLY fluffy, but it’s good pleasant romance.</p>

<hr />
<p><a href="https://dynasty-scans.com/series/a_timid_woman_longing_for_her_delivery_girl">A Timid Woman Longing For Her Delivery Girl</a>
***</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/fWLC8RN.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Warnings: Sexual Assault in backstory. Sick grandmothers as a plot point. Mid level drama.</p>

<p>Ms. Takase is a woman who works from home, and rarely leaves her house. She is afraid of the outside world, and others, after she was sexually assaulted at her old work, and her coworkers blamed her for it. Now she just wants nothing more than to be alone… until her delivery girl, who brings her her weekly groceries and other things, enters her life. Rinko is a bright and cheerful girl from the boonies, and while Ms. Takase is hesitant at first, they quickly become friends… or perhaps more?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/jY9mjgY.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Read this if you like: Short and sweet stories. It’s only three chapters long. Mid level drama, there’s some heavier misunderstandings, the pre-mentioned assault, and sick loved ones.</p>

<hr />
<p><a href="https://dynasty-scans.com/series/beauty_and_the_beast_girl">Beauty and the Beast Girl</a>
***</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/zEo9rgk.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Warnings: Age gap, mild drama, ecchi and has some smut that’s easily skipped</p>

<p>A half human half monster girl wander the wilderness alone. She is incredibly lonely, and not mean, but her appearance causes people to run from her, and since she’s a half monster, other monsters shun her. She lives in an abandoned shack full of books she’s found, and reads them to herself. One day, however, she runs into a young girl who doesn’t run from her. Lily, the young woman, is blind. The monster, for the first time in her life, lies, and claims she is a traveler, wandering far and wide. Lily asks her to tell her stories, and the monster recounts stories from the books she’s read so that she can keep this girl as her friend. As the monster has no name, Lily names her Heath, after her favorite flower.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/8S4qq7U.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Read this if you like: Monster girl stuff! Mild angst. but mostly cute fluff of two girls who are DEEPLY in love with each other, one of which just happens to be a big scary monster who would die for the other.</p>

***</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/CZ5DsVD.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Warnings: MAJOR age gap. One girl is a senior in high school and the other is nearing her 30s. Their relationship is “pure”, but y’know, that’s still massive squick.</p>

<p>This is a cute couple life manga about Hina-chan, a high school student, and her girlfriend, an office lady named Yayoi-san. Yayoi can’t take care of herself, and Hina comes over and cooks for her and other such things. It’s mostly cute sweet fluff, but has huge themes of age, maturity, and growing up.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/7B63HCf.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Read this if you like: The themes of maturity and growth. Couple life manga. If you handle such a large age gap, it’s actually quite good. Just y’know, illegal.</p>

<hr />
<p><a href="https://dynasty-scans.com/series/cant_defy_the_lonely_girl">Can’t Defy the Lonely Girl</a>
***</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/UOnesiK.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Warnings: Blackmail, kinda noncon</p>

<p>Ayaka is a young girl in highschool who wants to be JUST like her older brother, who is the perfect student and perfect older brother. She wants to get top marks like him and go to his college, which is REALLY hard to get into… but she’s absolutely TERRIBLE at taking tests. So her teacher offers to give her a recommendation so she can get in easily, if she’ll just get the delinquent, Honda-san, to actually come to school. Honda isn’t your typical delinquent. She’s kind of a quiet emotionless girl who just… doesn’t want to come to school, possibly due to depression.</p>

<p>Honda learns of Ayaka’s deal with the teacher, which worried Ayaka. If word gets out that she’s doing favors to get a recommendation, it could kill her socially with the other students! But Honda san offers a deal. If Ayaka does whatever Honda asks her to do, once per day, then Honda won’t tell anyone. And what kind of things will Honda tell her to do?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/NnGYXas.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Yep! Gay things!</p>

<p>Read this if you like: Shockingly wholesome stuff. Like, considering how it starts with noncon kissing, it evolves in a great way. Read this if you like seeing someone come to grips with loving someone else and just being too fucking dense to realize it.</p>

<hr />
<p><a href="https://dynasty-scans.com/series/useless_princesses">Useless Princesses</a>
***</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/GeUXCIU.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Warnings: Major angst</p>

<p>Nanaki and Kanade couldn’t be further opposites. Nanaki is a gyaru who is OBSESSED with being the prettiest girl. She’s rude and forceful, and a bit of a bully. Kanade, meanwhile, is a shy and quiet otaku wallflower. However, once Nanaki is dumped brutally by her cheating boyfriend, she can’t go to any of her friends, because they’re just as cruel and as big bullies as she is. So who is there to support her and give her a shoulder to cry on? The “ugly” wallflower, Kurosawa Kanade.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/RRGzZun.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Thus begins Nanaki’s slow character growth and transformation as she and Kanade grow closer…</p>

<p>Read this if you like: Major character growth plots. LOTS of angst and drama, no one in this manga is actually alright deep down.</p>

<hr />
<p><a href="https://dynasty-scans.com/series/tadokoro_san_web_comic">Tadokoro-San</a>
***</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/yfUTLLg.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Warnings: Very lewd</p>

<p>This one is interesting cause at one point, it was my #1 suggestion. I LOVED this manga. It’s severeled cooled on me though, especially after it just unceremoniously ended, with the artist ending it with a big sex scene that felt a little odd, after the entirely of the manga. Anyways, the description.</p>

<p>Tadokoro-san is a quiet gloomy otaku in high school. She draws manga and keeps to herself. Sakurako, meanwhile, is the school idol. She’s gorgeous, rich, and perfect in every way. So when Sakurako falls hopelessly in love with Tadokoro after seeing her art and how adorable she is, Tadokoro can’t help but be overwhelmed.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/eLERBx1.png" alt="yuri" />
<img src="https://imgur.com/8ltUki1.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Read this if you like: Essentially yandere, without any of the actual violence or death or anything. Sakurako is BASICALLY yandere levels of in lvoe with Tadokoro. So, read this if you like seeing really horny girls be VERY horny for other girls, because that’s like 70% of this manga. Also lots of height gap and gap-moe.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/dI67BqE.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Warnings: This is practically just porn, it’s so ecchi.</p>

<p>This is one of the goofier ones I’ll recommend.</p>

<p>i got this new anime plot. basically there’s this high school girl except she’s got huge boobs. i mean some serious honkers. a real set of badonkers. packin some dobonhonkeros. massive dohoonkabhankoloos. big ol’ tonhongerekoogers. what happens next?! transfer student shows up with even bigger bonkhonagahoogs. humongous hungolomghononoloughongous.</p>

<p>In all seriousness, there’s two girls. The cool prince of the school, Chiaki, and Harumi, who is a normal school girl who happens to have some serious honkers. Chiaki confesses to Harumi, but not y’know, a love confession. This isn’t about love. This isn’t even about sex or perversion! Chiaki just REALLY likes tits.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/fuIz8dI.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Chiaki must grope Harumi like, once a day, or she will run out of energy. Boobs are her recharging spot. She LIVES for boobs. This manga is so fucking stupid but I kinda like it anyway?</p>

<p>Read this if you like:  dobonhonkeros. massive dohoonkabhankoloos. big ol’ tonhongerekoogers. humongous hungolo-</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/vdRgxk9.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Warning: MASSIVE angst. Abusive relationships. Cheating. Pregnancy. Lots of self enforced heterosexuality and internal homophobia.</p>

<p>Maki and Midori dated all through highschool. Come the end of highschool, however, Midori decided to call it off. After all, they were “too old” to be “playing” at that anymore, right? They had to grow up. Start a family.</p>

<p>Ten years later, by a chance of luck, the two run into each other again! Midori is living her dream. She’s getting married, and she gets to meet her old highschool best friend again! At least, things look good… on the surface. Her marriage is worse than it looks, and re-discovering this long lost love isn’t helping. Can the two of them run away together, away from all of this?</p>

<p>Warnings: None I can think of</p>

<p>Hinako wants to be normal. She just doesn’t GET it. All her life, she’s been surrounded by a society that tells her she should fall in love. But she can’t. No matter what, she can’t. And then she ends up getting closer to her coworker in the office, Satou-san, a serious working scary girl… and something begins to change. But it’s not what society always told her it would be. What is this new feeling?</p>

***</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Aw0AA33.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Warnings: Really pushy girl with a crush</p>

<p>This comic is TECHNICALLY still going, but it’s two chapters away from the end and you can read it early if you pay. Which I have. So it goes here.</p>

<p>The Demon Queen sits up at the top of her tower. Whichever adventurer can reach the stop, through 100 floors and her right generals, can take her head and gain the admiration of the human kingdom and riches beyond their wildest dreams. But to reach that point, not even just kill the queen, you have to be top of your class. And the top of the adventurer guild’s school is none other than the mage Malori.</p>

<p>Too bad Malori has NO INTEREST in actually killing the Demon Queen and getting all that power and riches. No, she wants to marry the Demon Queen instead.</p>

<img src="https://imgur.com/SERkZsq.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Read this if you like: Slow burn with one girl head over heels. Idiot couples. Comedy, this one is actually very funny. Video games, it’s heavily inspired by JRPGs and is in an Isekai world, but is NOT actually an Isekai story, just takes place in a world where people from Earth get Isekai’d to.</p>

<p>Warnings: Vampires. Blood. Violence. Older than she looks age gap, though she’s still mentally a child, she IS a vampire.</p>

<p>Ichika is a normal kid. Her grandmother, a shrine maiden, just passed away. On the day of her funeral, a strange foreign girl named Aria appears… who claims to have been her grandma’s friend. She needs Ichika to do something for her, something ONLY maidens of this shrine can do. Aria wants Ichika to kill her.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/6ascKPB.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>What follows is a strange romance story where Ichika can’t help but fall in love with the terrifying, but very attractive vampire.</p>

<p>Also I fucking LOVE the art in this one.</p>

<p>Read this if you like: Action manga spiced with yuri. Vampires and monsters. Some horror and scary themes.</p>

<p>Warnings: Harem. One of the pairings is teacher x student. college kids.</p>

<p>Mei-chan just graduated highschool with her heart broken. The girl she was crushing on, her best friend, is straight as can be. Now that she’s going into college she’s decided not only will she reinvent herself, but she’ll GET A GIRLFRIEND! Very quickly, however, she meets five girls that she immediately falls head over heels in love with, and they also seem to be pretty into her, each in their own ways…</p>

<p>You have Riri, the touchy snuggly sweet friend who’s a bit reserved and shy, but has a surprising past as a sexy model. There’s Maria-Sensei, a psychology professor at the college who is The Mommy type and thinks Mei is the cuttest thing in the world. Minato Senpai, a prince-like older student who’s extremely into music, sound, and especially ASMR, and immediately falls in love with Mei’s voice, and also gets Mei involved in the local arts scene. That art scene also includes Karin-Senpai, an aspiring actor who is a kiss demon playgirl who IMMEDIATELY starts making out with Mei. Then finally, there’s Mei’s roommate, the irreverent ace senpai Kaoru, who takes a liking to Mei… and has a tendency to have her Switch Get Flipped when smelling Kaoru, due to a rather strong kink.</p>

<p>Yes, every character loves Mei for a different reason, and they’re all based on the five senses.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/6mbLSLu.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>No real clue where this one is going yet. It seems to ME to be a deconstruction of a lot of harem anime tropes, intentionally, and a bit of a parody of the idea, while also just being a good gay harem manga. Pretty much all the characters are fun in their own way. It’s 100% possible this will go the mythical route, the route that people like me would DREAM of seeing in a harem manga: THE POLYAMORY ROUTE. But we will have to see.</p>

<p>Warnings: High school girls. Mild drama.</p>

<p>Nagisa has just entered high school. It was not her first highschool choice… she, in fact, failed the exam for her first choice, because she missed the exam time because she was helping a sick girl. In her shame of failure, she reinvents herself, becoming a cool beauty. On her first day at her new school, however, she finds out that same girl who caused her to fail is in her class! And though she knows it’s not her fault, she can’t help but hate this student, Mashiro. Mashiro, however, quickly takes a liking to Nagisa…</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Q7NKsSC.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>This quickly evolves into some cute fluff romance between the two of them as they grow closer, both trying to change who they are. Nagisa doesn’t want to hate Mashiro for something she couldn’t control, and Mashiro wants to stop being a sickly burden on everyone. They carry each other out of this depression and these negative feelings. There’s also side romances that I’ll be real, I’m not as into. Nagisa and Mashiro are the real stars.</p>

<p>Cooking is how Nomoto de-stresses, but she has a tendency to cook way more than she could ever possibly eat by herself. So she invites her neighbor Kasuga, who lives alone and seems to really enjoy her food.

<p>Warnings: Incest as a plot point. Pushy main character (it chills out extremely after the first few chapters).</p>

<p>So, there’s a genre of manga that is very, very popular. Isekai into an otome game, where the main character falls in love with the villain of that story. I’m about to post like, three of these in a row, and they all have similar tropes and ideas, but are all good in their own ways.</p>

<p>In this one, ordinary office worker Rei wakes one day to find she’s in the body of the protagonist of her favorite otome game, Revolution. She knows this world inside and out, as she’s one of the most prolific fanfic writers of this world, so she’s researched it back and forth, especially involving her favorite character, the villainess, Vlaire Francois. The character has a tragic end in the story of the game, and Rei always wrote fanfic to change that. Now that she’s the mary sue protagonist, with incredible magic power, she will do everything in her power to protect Claire. The same Claire who hates commoners and is annoyed at Rei’s very existence.</p>

She is summoned, through her phone, to the world by the villainess, Lapis Tenenbrae, who is a cold chessmaster that Mitori knows is going to start a genocide against commoners. But Mitori, who had just been fired and was finding it hard to continue to live, now is given a new place to live, and new work to do, as her “miraculous future-telling” (she just knows the story very well) and office worker skills gets her hired by Lapis as her personal secretary. Mitori finally has a place to belong. And she decides, she’s going to do everything in her power to save Lapis and give the story a happy end.</p>

<p>Yvonne has been reincarnated into the world of an otome game as the rich villainess! According to the game’s plot, her loathsome role is to do little more than bully and mistreat the poor heroine of the story, Elsa. Yvonne doesn’t want to fit into her new role, but the game has a built in Villainess System that will punish her and harm those she cares about if she doesn’t do exactly what it says. It’s hard to do that though, when she doesn’t want to hurt Elsa, and when Elsa seems to be… intentionally getting closer and closer to Yvonne, almost as if…</p>

<p>Satsuki is an outcast at her school. She’s a creepy weirdo who is infamous for constantly lying to people. But she’s never actually lied. Not once. She cannot lie. She just keeps telling people… they’re going to die.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/VITYkEB.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Satsuki can see “ghosts” of people’s corpses 24 hours before they’re going to die. Using this power, she does everything she can to try and save her classmates from their inevitable deaths, becoming more and more hated with every word she says to try and warn them. And the ghosts keep coming. Something keeps trying to murder the students at her highschool. Why is that…?</p>

<p>Read this if you like: Mysteries and horror. This series is REALLY tense, like upsettingly so. I actually can’t bring myself to read it sometimes, it’s too much. Also, it IS yuri, but the yuri is much, much more subdued than anything else I’ve shown here. Satsuki is gay, and there are characters around her who are gay too, but that’s not the point of the story. So read this if you like horror with yuri elements.</p>

Now, many years in the future, Lappi finds herself living with Megu, the office girl. She wishes she could do SOMETHING to earn her keep, but she’s just a little stuffie…</p>

<p>A cute and interesting oneshot. I think some people might find this Very Weird, because it’s a sentient plushie and a human woman. But uh, I find it <em>adorable</em>. There’s also a lot of metaphor going on here, with parallels to like, disability and such. Very sweet, and one of my absolute favorites. But y’know, you’re warned. It can be seen as Weird.</p>

<p>It pissed me off beyond belief.</p>

<p>All of the reviews of this hack proclaim how it’s impressive that they made a good solid hack but didn’t make it impossible like all the other Zelda 2 hacks. I’m TERRIFIED to play other Zelda 2 romhacks now, because this is hard in a way I don’t appreciate. Zelda 2 is hard, yes, and I like a good challenge, and I know people will disagree with me here, but Zelda 2 is fair. This hack is not fair in a lot of parts. But we’ll get into it…</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/WPVOqfA.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Set as a sequel to Zelda 2, Ganon is defeated, Zelda is wakened, all is good and happy. However, Ganon can still be resurrected on the day his spirit is strongest, the WINTER SOLSTICE! Link must go out, power up the triforce from 6 temples, and then defeat Ganon’s shadow once and for all!</p>

<p>It’s a complete rework hack. The graphics are changed a lot, including giving Link a cute hood, but the main change is the layouts. It follows the same GENERAL ideas, though you get items and upgrades in a different order. Also, you start the game with 3 bars of health and 1 bar of magic. Yeah, that’s what I mean when I say this game is a little unfair and mean, right off the bat. Zelda 2 is actually pretty easy at the start, it eases you in, lets you get used to things, build up a small amount of spells, then it kicks you in the dick with Death Mountain. THIS game has Death Mountain literally RIGHT AT THE START. It’s the first thing you do, after getting shield. And it’s TWO TIMES AS LONG. I called it Deather Mountain. So yea, you’re fighting Dairas at like, level 1, trying to find your way to the first temple. With less health and magic than usual.</p>

<p>The bullshit doesn’t stop there. A lot of the level design is built SPECIFICALLY to be rude and mean. Lots of hard battles of crumbling bridges, lots of bubbles to knock you in pits, lots of Dairas. And since everything is new, you don’t know where to go to get your upgrades, so it took me FOREVER to get Life. Some things are VERY well hidden.</p>

<p>Another thing is that the map is too big. Like, its the same size as the normal zelda 2 map, but the way it’s set up is that to get from one area to the next, you need to travel through large spots with no path, so a bunch of random encounters, and several caves. Then you get to the spot you need to be at and explore, die cause oh shit every encounter has a blue daira, and then walk aaaalll the way back. There ARE shortcuts you can find, which help, but they’re barely helpful, and require you to usually beat an area first. Some areas are fucking HUGE. Maze Island is a NIGHTMARE. One thing that this has going for it is every temple has you start in the temple when you die, like the Great Palace does in vanilla Zelda 2. This is SUPER helpful, and the game would be impossible without it.</p>

<p>Is it bad? Well no, it’s Zelda 2. But like I said, Zelda 2 is both fun, and ramps up the difficulty rather well. This game is a wall, then a plateau after you get a lot of items (though it’s still hard), theeen you get to the final dungeon. Which… wow.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/hPAYVOc.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>This is Thunder Bird. In Zelda 2, he’s by far the hardest boss. His attacks are erratic and hard to dodge, he attacks all the time, and his pattern is wavy and hard to follow, especially when you’re dodging a bullet hell. You also need to use thunder to make him vulnerable, which, okay. You still have enough to cast shield and jump, which are basically required. How can we make this harder? How about we make it surrounded by water, so if you’re hit once, you’re prolly going in the drink and dying instantly. Okay, that’s pretty bad… but let’s make it worse. No spells. At all. Other than Thunder. No heal, no shield, and CERTAINLy no Jump. And this is at the end of a dungeon, so you prolly have like, 1.5 lives left.</p>

<p>This drove me up the wall. I was willing to ignore all of the earlier mean and bad design as just challenge that wasn’t QUITE for me but was still good, but no. This actually sucked. I could not stand it.</p>

<p>In the end, I wish I could, but I can’t recommend this hack. But if you’re like, a speedrunner of Zelda 2, MAYBE you’ll get more enjoyment out of it. Again, a lot of my friends loved it… but they were also all speedrunners lol. Ah well… This kind of killed my desire to play Zelda 2. I’ll try more hacks at some point, but… not for a while ):</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="NES" /><category term="retro games" /><category term="Zelda" /><category term="hacks" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 84</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/31/OOCY84.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 84" /><published>2024-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/31/OOCY84</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/31/OOCY84.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/8puvRoM.png" alt="&quot;Let's be best friends forever!

<p>So, NES RPGs, huh? I’ve been playing a lot of them recently. There’s a lot of really popular ones out there, like Mother, Final Fantasy, the Dragon Quest series… but what about the more obscure ones? Like, ones that didn’t come out over here? So continuing my NES RPG dive, I decided to check out this game, Lagrange Point, a prety obscure late-era NES Konami RPG. Although, there MAY be some of you who HAVE heard of this game… It has one thing that really, really sets it apart from everything else. Let’s talk about the VRC7 to start.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/drwX7MbB_IE?si=7MN9WyT3egN3hEar" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>So, most NES games use a 4-channel chiptune sound system, right? I don’t know EXACTLY how that works, I’m not a sound engineer, but I get the general idea. And also, most NES games use mappers, right? These are chips that go on the cart that change the specs of the system, giving more video ram and other such things. What if we put them together…? Well, we get some mappers that also change the music/sound capabilities of the NES, most notably in Konami’s own Castlevania 3. The Japanese version of the game used the VRC6 chip, which allowed things like bank switching and gave three additional sound channels. It really helps make a fuller sound. Gimmick also had something similar, again, only in Japan. Konami wasn’t done, however, and invented the VRC7 chip. In addition to its usual mapper capabilities, the VRC7  produces 6 channels of 2-operator FM Synthesis audio. Now, what does that mean? Well, it’ll make more sense if I say it’s basically a slightly cut up Yamaha YM2413, which was the sound chip used on the Master System and the MSX. Instead of the 9 channels of the normal chip, this one produces 6. Which is still more than the 4 the NES can usually produce. And on top of that, it’s SYNTH, not chip tune, so it produeces a COMPLETELY unique sound.</p>

<p>This game is the ONLY game that uses the VRC7 in this way. The chip was also in Tiny Toon Adventures 2, but was never used for music, just its usual Mapper stuff, so this is the only NES game with synthesis audio. This music has more in common with the Genesis than it does NES, or even SNES. It is EXTREMELy unique, and the music itself is really damn good, too. If this game is known for anything, it’s that. That’s its main claim to fame. And most people just listen to the OST and leave it at that, but I wanted to know what the game’s actual deal was. So I dove in.</p>

<p>Lagrange Point is a pretty typical JRPG in a sci-fi setting. It’s quite similar in vibes to Phantasy Star. Taking place on a space station set up in the Lagrange Point, the point of gravitational equilibrium between the moon and the earth, you play as Gene, a young pilot who works for a rescue team who are sent to the station after things go silent. Turns out, a coup has taken place. Basically, there was a doctor who determined that human-caused climate change was going to make the planet entirely unlivable within the next several years. He decided that the only way to save the Human race was to use bio-engineering and mutagents to mutate them into a higher form of being. Okay, that makes sense so far. …aaand then he declares himself The Bio Kaiser and sets up a violent fascist regime, killing everyone who isn’t loyal to him and trying to rule space and the Earth. Okay, you lost me. I don’t really see why that second part needed to happen, doc, you could have just tried to help people instead. But what do I know?</p>

<p>You’re one of the only survivors of your squad, and now you join the resistance to stop the Bio Kaiser. Along the way you’ll do chores and help out the different cities and people on this station, until finally you confront the Kaiser himself and take him out, thus saving the day. Uh, I guess we’ll forget the “the world is ending” thing. That’s not important.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/3YeoxiV.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>The story isn’t super interesting, though it has some little moments that really stand out. It feels kind of like a step between NES and SNES RPGs, where the story doesn’t really matter and it’s about the big adventure and exploring, but we also get a few cutscenes and characters that really set the tone. There’s a guy who hounds you the entire time, that feels more SNES-y than NES-y. And most notably, there’s a scene where one of the Bio Kaiser’s head generals violently slices a child apart on screen and you see him bleed out and the light goes from his eyes. That is not a fucking joke. It’s EXTREMELY dark and it comes out of mother fucking nowhere. He’s like, 4 or 5, too. It’s kinda fucked.</p>

<p>While Lagrange Point is rather typical JRPG fare, it has some things that set it apart from the crowd, some really unique ideas. You’ve got typical JRPG combat and gating your progress by different vehicles that you get licenses for, but the game also has a crafting system! Basically, there’s six elements, and combining two elements together will produce a weapon of a certain element. There’s a table you need to follow. And if these weapons are of the same level, the resultign weapon will be one level higher. So combining two level 1 weapons will produce a level 2 one. This is fine at first, buuuut, no rank 3 and above weapons are for sale in the game. Which means, to get a rank 3, you need 2 rank 2s you can buy. But to get a rank 4, you buy 4. For a rank 5, 8, And for the rank 6 weapons, which you’ll NEED to deck your party out with, you need to buy 16 fucking weapons. With a limited inventory. And you need them for all your party.</p>

<p>Not every party member can use them, though. You have a rather large cast of character, none of whom are super interesting, but they all have their quirks. Unique super abilities, unique spells they can cast (called kits here), and notably, some are robots. Robots use a unique weapon and armor system, so they’re easier to maintain. But they ALSO fall off way faster, as their rank 6 weapons are nowhere near as effective as non-robots.</p>

<p>Another unique system is the hype system. If the battle is “going well”, a character can get hype, increasing their chance to hit and critical hits. If its going bad, they can get nervous, which does the opposite. Unfortunately, there’s also characters who can get scared instead, which means they CAN’T attack. And the “going well” vs “going bad” thing is completely arbitrary. I walk outside and get into one battle, and they’re scared. This makes them unusable. Which sucks, cause this game has two women, and one of them is this character. You meet her and she’s like “ah, I’m a sexy badass resistance soldier. Alright boys, I GUESS you can join me, if you don’t mind being carried by a girl~” and then you get into one fucking fight and she goes “AAGH, A SPIDER!” and throws her weapon to the god damn ground. I mostly found the mechanic annoying. It adds nothing and takes away too much.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/cpb4xL4.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>The combat is pretty typical, though the enemy sprites are absolutely nuts. Weird-ass mutant designs, I love it. Here’s the Child Murderer, by the way. You can attack, use your kit techs, or use a super, if the character has a super (some have none). Gene’s supers are absolutely busted, doing massive damage to all enemies, though it takes health to use them. This is still really fast and good for grinding, kinda trivializing a lot of combat. Also, the game has a BP system. The best way I can describe it is it’s your mana, and everything uses it, except supers. Tech kits to heal? Yep. Tech kits to hurt? Also yep. Just basic attacking? Yepperoonie. If you run out, you’ll punch instead of fire your gun/swing your sword, which does basically nothing. You can buy new upgrades at stores, but keeping BP refills on hand is a good idea.</p>

<p>And that’s basically Lagrange Point. It’s got some cool settings and vibes, but over all is just pretty okay. 7/10. It has just a few too many mechanics that I found kind of annoying, or found to be literal busywork to pad the time. But it’s at least interesting, and the music of course is utterly fantastic.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="NES" /><category term="retro games" /><category term="obscure games" /><category term="Lagrange Point" /><category term="RPG" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry></feed>
