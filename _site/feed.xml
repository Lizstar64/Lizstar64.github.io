<p>So I got on a bit of a text adventure kick. We’ll be seeing a lot of them in the coming bit. This is a 1981 graphical text adventure by none other than Sierra Entertainment, who’d go on to be fucking humongous in the 80s. But this is still pretty dman early in their career. Hell, they’re still just called “On-Line” at this point, they’re not even Sierra yet.</p>

<p>This is one of the games in the “Hi-Res Adventure” series, a series of games for the Apple II that are text adventures, but with graphical images to show a general idea of where you are. A cute idea for the time, though the art is usually pretty…. rough. There’s this vibe that early Apple II art has that just tells me it was made by people who never actually learned how to make art. Perspective is wrong, things are just off, and god forbid if we get humanoid shapes. You don’t NEED to have the graphics on if they’re distracting though.</p>

<p>One of the weirder things about this is it’s actually a port. This was made by someone named Larry Ledden for Atari 8-bit computers. Sierra acquired the rights to port it and make a graphical version, which they did, though Ledden isn’t even given credit in this version.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/HTFEVVB.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Cranston Manor is a simple game with a lot of the trappings of other text adventures of the day. In it, you just sneak into the manor of a dead millionaire and steal the 16 treasures that are kept inside. That’s very Zork. In Zork, your goal is to wander around, solve simple puzzles, explore, and find treasures to bring back to a central location. This is basically just that, but with a manor.</p>

<p>As a text adventure, it’s perfectly fine. A little confusing at times? But the puzzles aren’t overly complex. Like for example, uh, there’s a robot that follows you to make sure you don’t steal anything. But he’s afraid of mice, so you take some cheese and mice start following you, so he runs away from you. Simple, right?</p>

<p>Over all, this isn’t a text adventure anyone remembers or talks about, but it’s an interesting blip in Sierra’s history!</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Apple II" /><category term="Obscure Games" /><category term="Sierra" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 150</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/06/09/OOCY150.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 150" /><published>2025-06-09T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-06-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/06/09/OOCY150</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/06/09/OOCY150.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/wVAfhxR.png" alt="'The feeling of a nipple!

<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p><strong>Collective</strong> - VOY
7/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/mKb6LNM.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Tom, Kim, Chokie, and Neelix are in the Delta Flyer shooting the shit and playing Poker. It’s cute. Neelix hustles them, Kim calls it the “Innocent Talaxian Routine”. Then oh, whoopsies, Borg Cube on the horizon. The Borg being weirdly sneeksy. Don’t they have like, alerts or sensors for that??</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/UcprNmf.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They explain they used a “Disperal Field” to mask their approach, which is a thing you can do? That sounds like they should do that all the damn time. They’re captured, and it’s now Neelix, Chokie, and Paris. Kim is missing. They wake up in an assimilation chamber, but they’re feeling pretty unassimilated. Voyager chases after them, and knocks them down to size. It’s weirdly too easy. Janeway tries to communicate with them, and they want a deflector dish for the crewmen they have captured. Why? It seems that their link with the collective has been severed, and they need it to call for reinforcements. Don’t want THAT. Seven beams over to try and secure their crewmates. What does she find? Children.</p>

<p>Borg Children. So, that IS kind of a thing. But usually they are just in muturation chambers until they fully grow. The adult Borg are missing, and now it’s just five. They’re confused, erratic and irrational, especially the one who’s basically taken control. So now we got terrifying children. My favorite!</p>

<p>They bring back a dead Borg and study it. It got sick. They can have the pathogen up and use it as a weapon (which the Doctor is VERY unhappy about), but its good to have the option in case we really want to kill these children. Because they ARE just children.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/uVjGBJ8.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Harry was never captured. They didn’t find him in the tubes of the Delta Flyer, so he’s our wild card for this episode.</p>

<p>It’s a group of five children, but it’s really just one bully bullying the other four to do what he wants, and he DEMANDS they return to the collective. Once they get another distress beacon out, the Borg will come and save them. Seven makes it clear that the Borg actually DID get their distress beacon, but decided they’re just not worth it. They don’t even want the CUBE? Damn. Janeway thinks they should just try and re-individualize these kids, like with Seven, but Seven is like “Captain that was hard with me, and I wasn’t a child. It’s gonna be impossible.” But if ANYONE can be Borg Mom, it’s her.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/hlvZPnv.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Another maturation chamber breaks and they have to take a baby out of it. It’s a horrible rubber baby thing. Anyways, they find Kim, and inject shit into him cause Kim Must Suffer. They decide to saw fuck it with any deals and just tries to rip the deflector dish off Voyager, which WILL blow Voyager up. But they bounce a graviton particle beam off it and blow up the tractor beam, which ALSO feels like they should do THAT more often, and it starts to blow up the Cube. The other Borg Kids stand up to the Bully, who then gets killed in an Explodium Accident, and they beam over to Voyager.</p>

<p>They’re trying to find homes for these kids cause WOW Voyager is not a good place for kids, but for now, Seven has to look after these kids. Will they be important in the future? Time will tell!</p>

<p><strong>Spirit Folk</strong> - VOY
8.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/K1CxbN3.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Paris is back in the Fair Haven program, I guess because they all still had access to the lot. Tom is driving around in a shitty old car, and breaks his wheel. He has the computer just make him a new one, but a hologram sees it and is like “oh that’s not normal”</p>

<p>We then get all the Irish holograms in the hologram pub like “clearly they are the fae folk”. Well, two of them are REAL into the idea, at least. How the hell are these Holograms able to do this? Wouldn’t they have programmed some kind of safety in so that they don’t notice the computer doing things? Other programs don’t have that problem. Well, I have a good answer for that. Shut up, who  cares. I like excuses for things to be stupid.</p>

<p>The drunks see Harry and a girl on a date, and then the girl turns into a cow. Tom is pranking Kim. But they just saw a townsfolk turn into a fuckin’ cow. When Harry and Kim wander off, leaving the Cow (they’re called to the bridge), the drunkards take the cow and bring it to church.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/e27131C.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The Doctor is telling a sermon when they bring in the cow. He fixes the problem, but not in a super subtle way. Everyone begins to connect the dots and talk about all the small things they’ve seen. Time to burn the witches!! Janeway’s boyfriend confronts her about it. Huh.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/MRzoi2d.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Well, something is clearly broken. They bring up Janeway’s boyfriend and yep, he’s got some broken files. Those files are supposed to stop him from noticing anything’s wrong. Why is this happening? Well, they’re running Fairhaven nonstop. They just lef tthe computer on too long, you understand. So they’re gonna go and fix the problem by doing something in the pub. But Sullivan, the boyfriend, warns everyone. So now they’re PREPARED. They start up a wild witch hunt and riot to burn them out cause oh no scary things we don’t understand. Yeah that’s prolly how it’d go.</p>

<p>They shoot at them, and blow apart the safeties as they hit the computer panels. Welp. Now they have Kim and Tom tied up, so they need to get people in there to help them. Luckily the Doctor is the preacher, so he can just convince them to stop!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/UZgTAI2.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This is one of the best images we’ve captured for Voyager.</p>

<p>Anyways the Doctor is captured, and his mobile emitter is removed from him, so he becomes frazzled by the Holodeck’s errors. So he becomes hypnotized and tells them everything. All the simple folk don’t understand, or care, but Sullivan does. He kind of gets it, he’s a science man, so he asks to be taken to Voyager. He uses the Holo-Emitter, and goes out into Voyager.</p>

<p>They show him around, and explain to him what’s going on. He’s a pretty good guy so he takes it shockingly in stride. “Just cause we’re from different worlds doesn’t mean we can’t care for each other”. He helps stop them from burning Harry and Kim alive, and everything is okay. Now they just think they’re space men from the future. It’s not quite the same, but it feels weird to just erase their memories. They can’t just keep the open door policy though and keep it on for any longer. Things can always get worse. Janeway and Sullivan have one last cute moment, and then he’s NEVER SEEN AGAIN, OOOOOOH</p>

<p><strong>Ashes to Ashes</strong> - VOY
7/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/TUweOX8.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We see an alien fleeing some people chasing and attacking her, speaking in another language. Then, in English, she sends out a request to Voyager for aid. She looks like an Asari, and is just as hot.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on Voyager, one of the Borg Kids finds the message from the alien, who is kinda humored by the idea that a KID is answering her distress call, and asks her patch her over to Janeway. But the message cuts off before she can. The Borg Kid is being chased by the adults who are like “You are NOT supposed to be here”. But then they find out about the alien, and patch her over after all.</p>

<p>She identifies herself as Ensign Lyndsay Ballard, who was a member of the crew a few years ago and died. They don’t trust her, which she’s not offended by, and explains that after she died in an accident, she was found by some aliens, the Kobali. Basically they revive dead aliens and turn them into them as a way to procreate. WEIRD ass way to procreate. Her story seems to check out. Kim is kind of FLOORED by this, because she died on an away mission with him.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/MqEUgTR.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The Kobali are still hunting her. See, this is why this is a weird way to procreate. Of course she wouldn’t want to stay with some new family, why the fuck would they even do this??? At least erase their desire to escape or something while you’re in there bringing them back from the dead?</p>

<p>Lyndsay is VERY pleasant. She’s funny and sassy in a way I like. “This is so weird for me,” says Kim. “Really? This is just a normal day for me.” or she goes “Hey, show some respect for the dead”.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Borg Kids are hard to wrangle and Seven is trying to be very disciplined as their new mother. It is not working. I’m more interested in the Lyndsay stuff. She tries to assimilate back in, and is taking cosmetic surgery to appear more Human, basically. But she’s been with the Kobali for three years, so it’s a bit weird. She slips into another language, food doesn’t taste the same.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/4jtSmNG.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Hey look her surgery is going well, she’s really cute.</p>

<p>Kim is thinking of asking her on a date, but he’s cucked by the Captain, who already invited her to dinner. Unfortunately, she seems to have a mental breakdown at dinner, after she asks why the Captain sent her on the away mission even though others, like Torres, were better suited for it. Was it cause she was expendable? But she’s not upset, because Kobali don’t get upset about whoever caused their death- ohhh no. After her freakout she has a nightmare, and then she goes to Kim, who comforts her, and they kiss. Sorry Captain, looks like you lost.</p>

<p>BTW at dinner, Janeway ruins a potroast she’s replicating, somehow. And they’re talking about weapons they can use against the Kobali if they come back, and Lyndsay asks “have you tried using your potroast?” and then is STUNNED she did that, but we’re like “HOLY SHIT THAT WAS SO FUNNY”</p>

<p>And then her Kobali dad shows up like “I only want to  speak to her”. They allow him to, cause she allows it. He explains that USUALLY memories don’t come back, but sometimes they do, and things like this happen. And then what happens is basically a trans allegory. “What did they do to you, Jetlaya? You were so beautiful before.” “My name is not Jetlaya, it’s Lyndsay.” Constantly calling her what she doesn’t want to be, telling her she’s confused and… it’s kinda gross and uncomfy and now I’m REALLY nervous about how this episode is going to go??? He tells her that Lyndsay died years ago, and she can’t be that person now. He’s also willing to blow himself up, cause he refuses to go home alone, because that’s his daughter.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/WK3rza7.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Things unravel more. She doesn’t remember some things, like her original dad. She’s still thinking things in the alien language, not English. She realizes it’s not Voyager that’s different, it’s her, so she can’t stay. As the Kobali attack, Kim is all pissy about letting her go even though she’s said she WANTS to go, and suggests blowing up her dad’s ship which like, what the fuck Kim. She tells him the girl he loved died a while ago, and he has to let her go. I don’t know how to feel about this anymore. I like the idea of it, and the sci-fi-ness of it, but I think parts of it aren’t done very well. Ironically, she’s way too likable. They also didn’t do well enough to really explore the differences and why she’d want to stay.</p>

<p><strong>Child’s Play</strong> - VOY
7.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/VCECQZK.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>There’s a science fair, all the kids are showing off their science projects. Seven is VERY proud of her kids. One of them LITERALLY made an Alien Ant Farm. But things hit a bit of a snag, when she finds out that one of them is going to leaving soon, as they’ve found his family. She is NOT happy. Oh no, Empty Nest Seven.</p>

<p>For what its worth, Icheb isn’t very happy about this either. He doesn’t remember his family. They’re not technologically advanced, and he’s VERY into astronomical stuff that he can’t study, at all, living on a farm. Honestly, all very fair. Everyone tells him he should be happy and it’ll be GOOD for him to be with his “real” parents but he already HAS “real” parents and people to care for him here.</p>

<p>Also the planet here is a lightyear away from a Borg warp conduit and so they’ve been attacked by the Borg a lot. Gee, sounds like a great place to drop this kid off at.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/4itDFUJ.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>It doesn’t go well. Icheb is not interested in returning, and Seven is unhappy because she doesn’t think they can care for him properly. Which they can’t, like, obviously. “We can’t LEAVE this planet, it’s our home! We will defend it to the last against the Borg!” Well, poor Icheb is gonna be reassimilated ain’t he</p>

<p>They push him to at least TRY. He’s grumpy, but he tries, and does kinda get back into the spirit of it. He enjoys their food,  his favorite when he was a kid, tries to interract with the people down there. They can’t provide for his dreams, but he’s very smart. They need smart people like him to help them survive, it’s a rough world.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/qxQWnyu.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Eventually he decides he does, in fact, want this. There’s a thing about how home is so important, and they prove it to him by explaining how Voyager is trying so hard to get home. Okay y’all. There’s a heartfelt goodbye as he teleports off to his new home. The episode is not over yet, that’s not a good sign. The other kids are sad. They’re like “I hope you don’t find my parents, I want to stay here”. Damn kids. Seven ALSO learns that Icheb’s father lied to them about both when Icheb was taken, AND where. Clearly something is sussy. Seven demands they turn around and rescue him, and Janeway’s like “Seven it’s 3 in the morning”</p>

<p>They go back anyway, and it turns out they’re basically sacrificing their children, infecting them with a pathogen and making a bouy with kids on them that are infected so that they can fight off the Borg. “This is what we HAVE to do to survive! With us being so close to the Borg, it’s the only way!”</p>

<p>THEN.</p>

<p>FUCKING.</p>

<p>MOVE.</p>

<p>I will NEVER respect this argument. YOU ARE IN SPACE. THERE ARE OTHER PLACES TO LIVE. If a fucking volcano appeared next to my house I wouldn’t be like “Time to throw kids into the lava to try and calm it” I’d fucking MOVE.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/xcNXXnx.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They save Icheb from the Borg Sphere zoom the fuck out of there. Icheb is finding it hard to get past, and blame, his parents for what they did. But yeah it was fucked up. Seven is piiiiissed at them. And if he DOES want to fight the Borg in the future, he can decide to, in his own way. I’m sure that won’t be relevent.</p>

<p><strong>Good Sheppard</strong> - VOY
5.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/eWzgRPF.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We get a bunch of shots of some random lower deck crewmen going about their day. A Bajoran bringing a message from Seven to Engineering, an Engineer taking that message to another Engineer, who’s a kind of sassy bitchy dude who’s annoyed he has to actually do work. There’s also a sick-ass shot of them moving out through the window to the outside of the ship. Well I dunno what any of this means but, cool.</p>

<p>Seven is working on grading everyone on their efficiency. Harry’s late night crew has not enough to do. There’s a hypochondriac who’s afraid of medicine who’s slowing down medicine, a slightly incompetent astrometrics specialist, and a VERY competent engineer who doesn’t actually want to do any work. Three problem children. What to do? Janeway decides that these three have slipped through the cracks, and she needs to do something about it, so she decides to take them with her on an away mission to get to know them better. Two of them are actually perfectly happy to go on the away mission, maybe a bit nervous. The lazy one is NOT happy lol. Seven doesn’t think that it’s a good idea. Janeway counters her with Random Biblical Shit, citing the story of the Good Sheppard not letting even one member of her flock go.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/FpomEh6.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>I know this is going to go pear shaped, but I kinda want this to just be a normal field trip. Oh sorry, I did that wrong. PLEASE LET THIS BE A NORMAL FIELDTRIP. WITH THE JANEWAY? NO WAY! AWWWWW.</p>

<p>The Hypochrondriac and the incompetent one are nice. The Genius But Lazy one I want to punch in the face. He’s like Distilled Big Bang Theory. Well okay, the Hypochondriac tries to get out of the away mission because he’s been infected by a fucking prion disease. How many mad cows are you eating in the Delta Quadrant, ensign???</p>

<p>Janeway is trying to connect with these random misfits, and it’s not going great, but then they get hit by something that tears off a piece of the hull and knocks out a lot of systems. Lazy guy assumes it’s a phenomena he’s theorized about, but has no proof of, and he’s betting EVERYTHING on it. Alright dude.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/sD05UVd.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>I really, REALLY feel for this girl. She’s not like, actually dumb or incompetent. Her skills just aren’t really for what they’ve got going on here. She was put here as a sympathy hire cause she’s Bajoran, or at least that’s how she feels.</p>

<p>Shit gets worse as another anomaly comes at them. They try to distract it with a photon torpedo, and then the hypochrondriac goes “oh no” and is teleported out.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/xzFlvNY.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>He’s teleported back, with the feeling of something inside him, crawling around. It sounds MASSIVELY uncomfortable. Oh my god, he’s going to get Alien’d. Anyways it turns out the lazy shithead is a shithead, he’s awful. When an alien DOES burst out, he IMMEDIATELY goes blasting, killing something that might not have been violent or dangerous. Now we’ll never know. All we know is that the Hypochondriac could feel its thoughts, specifically “Do not belong”. Before it left, it maybe cured him of his hypochondria. Janeway thinks that since he actually DID have something, it kinda scared him cured. Okay, sure.</p>

<p>Janeway demands they abandon ship and leave her as she makes a stand against the aliens coming at her. They refuse. Well, the two good ones refuse. The lazy one gets in an escape pod, but then sacrifices himself, cause “maybe I’ll understand what I’m missing”. It really just adds more for them to do, cause now they have to rescue him too. come on, man. They do a maneuver, and an explosion happens, and then they wake back up on Voyager. The end.</p>

<p>Didn’t really land the ending. We needed one more scene where it shows they belong here now, instead of Janeway just going “it’s okay, they belong here now”. Aight.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="Voyager" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Retro Achievement Mastery 182 - Zork I</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/06/08/RA182-Zork.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Retro Achievement Mastery 182 - Zork I" /><published>2025-06-08T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-06-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/06/08/RA182-Zork</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/06/08/RA182-Zork.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/wcR0ZN7.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>So I recently played Return to Zork, and talked a bit about the later Zork series, but I cannot stress enough how big Zork really was. Like, it was HUGE. One of the first big smash video games. Originally released in 1977 for mainframe computers, it had to be split into three parts with later home computer releases cause they couldn’t even handle it. Only one of these actually has achievements so far, so I’m just playing Zork 1 for now.</p>

<p>Zork is not the first text adventure. It was inspired by Colossal Cave Adventure, which also wasn’t the first, but was probably the first well known one. Well, well known among nerds. The creators of Zork all worked at MIT and were huge nerds. Zork itself is based on a Huge Nerd terminology. It was slang around the office. The word “Zork” was just the file name MIT nerds in the 70s used for programs they hadn’t named yet, and then it stuck and they didn’t want to change it to anything else.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/lsTo4hy.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Zork is weird and irreverent. It’s built on fantasy games like D&amp;D and whatnot, but it’s also got a lot of American energy to it. The way I always describe it is, Zork is Midwest America’s Discworld. A lot of that is still here in the first one, but to a lesser degree. The lore of Flatheads is kinda here, we have the Dam here, you can visit it.</p>

<p>Zork is really just a giant maze, with some smaller mazes thrown in, and a lot of really weird “puzzles” that usually involve bringing an item from one far off room to another. Once you break it down into its constituent parts, it really isn’t that complex and doesn’t take a long time. Fuck, you can turn the entire winning playthrough into a song. Here you go: https://debsanderrol.bandcamp.com/track/walkthrough</p>

<p>Is Zork GOOD to play these days? Eh. It’s more interesting than anything, and I have a deep love for it, but like, there are much better text adventures to play, even. Just play Zork Zero.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Apple II" /><category term="Retro Games" /><category term="Zork" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Retro Achievement Mastery 181 - Virtual Hamster</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/06/06/RA181-VHamster.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Retro Achievement Mastery 181 - Virtual Hamster" /><published>2025-06-06T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-06-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/06/06/RA181-VHamster</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/06/06/RA181-VHamster.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ahTPITw.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Yes, this IS a game. Kind of. So the 32X bombed like, real hard. Like a lot of bombed consoles, this resulted in a lot of games being cancelled. Most of the time we just get little hints at what could have been, screen shots in magazines, some developer explanations. But here, we get the full on prototype of a cancelled 32X game, Virtual Hamster! Its weird.</p>

<p>The only way to describe this, is you are a hamster on a hoverboard going through cyber tubes. Imagine the Sonic 2 halfpipe stages, it’s BASICALLY that. You slide down along the sides cause of gravity, but can move all around if you get good momentum. There are enemies, though they don’t seem to do anything, and there are powerups, they don’t do anything either.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Snktm9F.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>There’s a big full map, which is just a tied up knot of tunnels. Sometimes a turn comes in the pipeway, and you’ll go in the direction you’re tilted, left or right. This makes it VERY confusing to know where the fuck you’re going, but there IS a map, which helps. Though uh, helps for what? That’s it. There’s nothing else here.</p>

<p>Virtual Hamster is a weird game, a look into the hints of what game dev was like at the time, but even with that, I have no idea what this would be. Probably not super fun lol</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="32X" /><category term="prototype" /><category term="Virtual Hamster" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 149</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/06/06/OOCY149.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 149" /><published>2025-06-06T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-06-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/06/06/OOCY149</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/06/06/OOCY149.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/XiwfU6L.png" alt="Girl shakes as she looks at two other girls close together 'I...

<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p><strong>Fair Haven</strong> - VOY
6/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/MWNHUpY.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This episode is totally a “We had this set on lot” episode, and they just ran with it.</p>

<p>In this episode, Paris has invented a new holoprogram called Fair Haven, which is an idealized version of a 19th century Irish village. Paris makes it clear, he wants this to be just what it is. No aliens, no leprachauns, no magic. Just… a place to escape and relax. A lot of people get into it. The Doctor sets himself as a priest, for example. And according to him, Janeway is very into Irish history. Oh… she is? I mean, yeah, of course! We all remember…. that aspect about her! She also gives eyes at a bartender, which Worries me because Star Trek NEVER does one episode romance well.</p>

<p>Suddenly the episode becomes a completely different episode as they’re all studying an anomaly. It’s gonna make them sit there for a few days. To keep spirits up, they have the holodecks running at all times.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/expjNUT.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>At the very least, this episode isn’t like…. okay, do you remember that episode of TNG where they’re evacuating a colony that’s literally just Ireland? This is better than that, but I’m always worried when an episode is like the “THIS CULTURE” episode. Like, even if it’s something where I’m like “you can’t be racist to it, they’re white people” if this was a French episode and everyone was holding baguettes and goin’ HON HON HON you’d be like “okay I dunno about this”. This is treading very, very carefully on that. And when I say it’s the Irish episode, like, it’s VERY Irish. It’s all anyone is talking about, basically.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/JIqc8aw.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Janeway goes into the program’s data and makes some edits (probably without Paris’ knowledge of wanting of her doing that) to the bartender. I have never seen a woman more downbad than this one image. Look at her fuckin’ DRAPED. She makes some edits to his background, makes him more into arts and literature. Makes him more “complicated”, more confrontational (Janeway is a bottom, okay, that’s not what I expected). And then…. one of the best lines I’ve ever seen in a Star Trek episode.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/7GBqO96.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>DELETE. THE. WIFE.</p>

<p>Okay so Kate Mulgrew is very hot and if she was being horny at me, I’d become a puddle on the floor, but there’s something massively uncomfortable about watching Star Trek characters be horny, in that same way I don’t like romance plots in these episodes. I mean, thinking about it in the most abject way, bringing it down to its most base concepts, Captain Janeway is currently making a holofuck doll. To her EXACT specifications. It’s weird now when horny 28 year olds who never aged past 14 do it, and it’s weird when she does it. It’s just weird, and uncomfortable. At the very least, AT THE VERY LEAST, this time it’s not a fucking nazi.</p>

<p>Good scene with Seven and some random guy in the bartender</p>

<p>“I possess superior hand-eye coordination.”
“That’s not all that’s superior. The lily and the rose are staging a competition on your face.”
“Clarify.”
“The fullness of your lips and the paleness of your cheeks – it’s enough to make a man faint.”
“Then, in that case, perhaps we should sit down.”</p>

<p>Dude’s got game. That’d work on me.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/2peVRo8.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Things go further with the bartender, Michael Sullivan, and he and Janeway kiss. She then ghosts him when she kinda freaks out about it. He then starts a fucking bar fight with Paris over “WHERE IS SHE”. When Janeway finds out, the Doctor takes her on a walk around the deck. Like, literally, they circle the set like 2 times. She admits to him what made her freak out. It wasn’t a “oh no I’m falling for him, a hologram” thing like I thought it might be. Cause like, she had a LONG time to stop that. No, she was there, cuddling with him… and then he began to snore. She was like “Oh, don’t like that. Oh well, I can just change it” and then realized that’s <em>kinda fucked up</em>, and it made her freak out.</p>

<p>The idea of falling in love with someone who you can meld and control all of their feelings and thoughts and very being, that IS uncomfortable, and is it really love? The Doctor makes the argument that it doesn’t matter what he is or how his molecules are aligned, what matters is the kind of person he and she are. Though maybe don’t edit his program in the future.</p>

<p>They make it clear of the anomaly, though it destabalizes the program that’s currently running, Fair Haven. They can maybe save like, 10% of it. Paris asks Janeway if there’s anything she wants him to try and save specifically.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/dTDSSDk.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>She brings him up and lets him know she’s not gonna be around as much. But she might be around in the future, cause she can’t quit him. And then she makes one last change to his behavioral subroutines. “Deny Janeway any future access to editing his behavioral subroutines”. That’s nice. Though I notice she DIDN’T deny access to physical subroutines.</p>

<p>“Computer. 12 inches.” And then he becomes 12 inches and she’s like “wait wait wait”</p>

<p>It’s fine. I kinda like where it took things by the end but it was a bit wishy washy about that, too.</p>

<p><strong>Blink of an Eye</strong> - VOY
10/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Ez2CTgd.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Voyager finds a torus planet in space. Oh shit, it’s a Final Fantasy world. They go to look at it but get dragged into orbit.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on the planet, a new light appears in the sky as the planet starts shaking. The inhabitants of the planet begin to worship the new star, calling it “Earthshaker”, the new greatest god in the sky.</p>

<p>Back on Voyager, we find ourselves stuck in orbit, unable to escape due to engineering problems. They’re working on that. They also register that due to some Plotium core in the planet, the planet is in a different timeline than us, basically. For every second above, a full year happens down there.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ZJSGmf3.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We then jump ahead, a few minutes for them, centuries for the people on the surface. It’s like an early medieval age now. We’ve got a “Protector” and his sage advisor. He sends a message up to the Earthshaker asking it to stop shaking their planet, as it keeps knocking down their walls and, worst of all, made him trip during an important meeting.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ru74JdI.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Jump ahead even further, to a like…. early 1900s almost. They’re studying Voyager now through telescopes, and know it’s a ship. They call it the Sky Ship. They have comics and stories about it. THey send radio waves up with prime numbers, and a message like “Hey, please stop shaking our planet. I hope you’re a friend.”</p>

<p>This is VERY interesting. Prime Directive is kind of out the window considering what’s been going on, but they DO want to try and minimize damage as much as they can. They decide to send down a spy, but any person they send down there would prolly die from the temporal shock, at least. So they send down the Doctor. They try to bring him back quickly but lose him due to problems, and then finally manage to bring him back… three years later, for him. He explains that they people on the surface are perfectly pleasant and technologically advancing, in part due to Voyager. But there’s also a space race. Who can get to the spaceship first. And for some, it’s for science and exploration. For others…. it’s for war and power. As with any multi cultural planet, right?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/w2nvPbw.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Some astronauts blast up. Luckily, they’re an exploration type. They go up, and then all their messages suddenly get weird and garbled. Huh, that’s strange. Well, their job is to try and learn all they can from the Sky Ship. They dock, go in, and everyone is frozen. And then the time collapses on them VERY suddenly, killing one, but the other can be saved. He’s an anxious guy, but very smart. He’s excited to be here. Scared. Everyone he knew is now dead down there. But he wants to help them, and this was always his dream. He’s also worried because knowing how life is in the rest of the universe, he’s afraid his people may not be able to explore space, which was always his dream.</p>

<p>While he’s up there, technology keeps growing. Aaaand they developed warp technology. And then they send fucking torpedos up. While I’m like “what the fuck” I DO kinda get it. The astronaut goes back down to try and tell them to stop. His people have become a bit more militaristic, and when he tries to communicate, they’re like “Who the hell are you? You’re dead. Good thing you left, we’re about to blow it out of the sky.”</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/fnq6wGc.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Voyager’s shields go down to zero JUST as something else comes up… it’s the astronaut! He beams on with a temporal compensator, and explains he can’t stay for long, the technology isn’t QUITE there yet. But he wishes them luck, helps them escape, and then we end with him, old now, watching the light fade out in the sky.</p>

<p>This is peak Star Trek. In the following episodes,</p>

<p><strong>Virtuoso</strong> - VOY
7.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/OjAlB0J.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Voyager has run into some aliens who are like, the fucking worst. The Qomar, they are rude, egotistical, and awful all around. They treat the Doctor like he’s nothing (one of them over ennunciates as if he can’t understand her, so I guess they’re from the American Planet), call them all inferior, and complain that their inferior technology damaged their systems. Voyager is trying to help them repair it, and while the doctor prepares their medicine, he absently hums. Well at least this time they didn’t just invent a hobby for him. Last episode Chakotay was like “You know I love anthropology”, and the one before that “Janeway has ALWAYS been into the Irish”. This time he at least has an established enjoyment of singing.</p>

<p>Anyways, these aliens never actually invented music, so they are STUNNED. “It’s a unique mathematical variation, how did they invent it???” And he’s like “what”.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/zmuC67G.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Did you ever want an episode that was just Robert Picardo singing? I didn’t know I wanted that, but that’s what this is! The Qomar ask to get a concert (well, they want full access to the doctor), and Janeway suggests a concert. They put on a concert, with the Doctor as a star attraction. They’re REALLY into it, but when they try and get anyone else on like Kim playing clarinet, they ONLY want the Doctor. Poor Kim. It DOES stroke the Doctor’s ego, though.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/5mPw7Ov.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Doctor gets more and more popular among the Qomar. THey’re very, VERY excited and interested in learning more. He puts on some concerts on the planet, and they LOVE it. Seven then calls Janeway over and suggests the Qomar are trying to sabatoge Voyager by sending so much useless data to their comms systems by literally DDOSing Voyager. And with what? Fan mail. So much fan mail asking stupid irrelevent questions like, how much can he calculate pi?</p>

<p>Is this episode a commentary on how people who watched Voyager only cared about the Doctor? Is this episode a commentary on <em>me</em>? Prolly more just fandom in general, which is a little much. The Doctor lets more and more things get to his head. Some Qomar try to seduce the Doctor, which makes him so uncomfortable he turns himself off. One of them, Tincoo, seems to be falling fo him. And then of course, there’s THIS.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ZHIVZ59.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This is the funniest shit I’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>The Doctor gets SO into this that he requests to leave Voyager and stay with the Qomar. Again, a lot of this is because of ego, and because he thinks one of the Qomar is falling for him (they’re obviously not). This is OBVIOUSLY a very bad idea, and is not how this is going to actually go. And most people are not taking it well. His closest friends are kind of offended he’s leaving just for his ego, like Seven. It’s nice that she’s like, very VERY hurt about all this.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/6Ac7PZF.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>So, this is a program the girl he THOUGHT was into him made to replace him. He can sing in ways the Doctor can’t, superior in every way. They’re making a Hatsune Miku. The Doctor almost realizes how fucking stupid he’s being about all of this. Almost. He has a bit of a breakdown, like, “BELANNA, I NEED YOU TO ERASE MY MEDICAL SUBROUTINES AND MAKE ME BETTER AT MUSIC”. He’s ALMOST burned too many bridges to do this, but she eventually hits him with a “You know, I CAN do this and turn you into just a music bot, but you won’t be you anymore”. He’d sacrifice everything he is, and has, to keep famous. And is that really worth it?</p>

<p>He gives one last Opera performance, this being the only one NOT performed by Robert Picardo, as Tincoo watches. Tincoo then introduces her new Doctor Clone. The Qomar are super, SUPER into it, and immediately forget that stinky old Doctor they used to have singing for him. How fickle is fame? There’s a hard fucking cut with him singing a weird song that’s like, just noise. Which IS a valid kind of music, but you know. Not when it’s made by kind of a dickhead.</p>

<p>The Doctor had ended up offending a lot of the crew, but he’s reinstated. He’s willing to erase his singing subroutines, but is told “nah you don’t need to go that far”. He’s kind of disgusted by the whole thing, and when Seven delivers more fanmail, he’s like “fuck that shit”, but she reads it anyway. It’s fanmail from her, to him, about how much she respects him.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/4x3P9cB.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>It’s genuinely a really heartwarming ending. Not a bad episode over all.</p>

<p><strong>Memorial</strong> - VOY
10/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/oKhC472.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Paris, Neelix, Chakotay, and Harry return home to Voyager after a two week away mission. Harry is just glad to be back home with working sonic showers and not near three other smelly men. Paris returns to Torres, who built him an authentic 50s TV, which is VERY cute and adorable. He stays up late watching old cartoons, and then the TV swaps to a war movie, which bothers him for some reason, but he can’t change the channel. And then he sees himself in the TV. Huh! Interesting setup.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/GRQEeg2.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>It’s not just him. Kim hallucinates in the Jeffries Tubes. Neelix freaks out at a kettle whistle and people sneaking up on him. He becomes VERY protective of Naomi, telling her to “Get down” behind the counter as people come in. Chakotay is having nightmares of a battle, but is woken up by Tuvok telling him that Neelix has barricaded himself in the messhall and is basically holding Naomi hostage (he thinks he’s protecting her).</p>

<p>Obviously something is wrong. They appear to have been in a war, and they don’t even remember it. And it doesn’t help that everyone appears to be suffering from terrible PTSD. Well, everyone except Chakotay, who still cannot act. THey remember volunteering, though the fact that they can’t even remember what happened implies they were kind of coerced.</p>

<p>Their memories slowly come back. They were working to try and evacuate some aliens, the Nakan. Something happened, no one knows what, no one saw. Either their people fired first, or some colonists. Some of the soldiers tried to protect the colonists. Some didn’t, just shooting them out of fear.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/YVQoEQL.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>How each of them handles this is different. Harry is scared, and shoots some of the colonists. Neelix tries to protect them, and thinks they shouldn’t have even been there in the first place. Either way, 82 civilians were killed in a massacre. All of them. No survivors.</p>

<p>Neelix and Harry have nervous breakdowns over what they did. Paris is next, screaming at Belanna to leave him alone so he can just stare at a wall. I mean I do get that, tbh. Chakotay is there.</p>

<p>They go over the logs, go to the system where it happened, and then JANEWAY remembers being there, killing civilians. But she was very, VERY clearly on Voyager for two weeks. The scene we get with her is GRAPHIC. Her commander shoots the corpses, and is like “we will cover up the evidence”, and she’s DISGUSTED, demanding that they need to band together and make sure no one forgets. But most of the rest of them refuse, getting belligerent. Whatever IS happening here is also starting to spread. The entire ship is being pulled into this alien conflict, in their memories.</p>

<p>Janeway NEEDS to know that it wasn’t ACTUALLY athing they did that just became erased somehow. They set a course.</p>

<p>Neelix asks Seven how she handles the memories of what she did was a Borg. Is it because guilt is irrelevant? No, of course not. It is VERY important. She remembers what she did frequently, and moves on, lets it guide her, so she never hurts anyone ever again. It’s a VERY good scene.</p>

<p>They land on the planet, and go hunting. Harry find the victims he personally killed, and finds… corpses, yes. But they died 300 years ago. More exploration, and they find a giant memorial that occasionally pulses. The soldiers here (or SOMEONE) built this memorial, sending out a memory pulse to anyone passing by, so that it wouldn’t be forgotten. No one will forget. Most of Voyager is like “okay good, let’s turn it off now”. But Neelix is like “we can’t turn this off and destroy the evidence”. I think this an interesting moral dilemma, and for the record, some of my chat disagree on this a lot. Janeway eventually decides not to turn it off, and instead puts a warning bouy near the system. Prolly the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>They leave, but they will NEVER forget.</p>

<p>Very interesting episode.</p>

<p><strong>Tsunkatse</strong> - VOY
9/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/QKIvIp6.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This episode is very interesting for one reason, and it’s this:</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/0C6S71X.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>SPECIAL GUEST: THE ROCK. YEP. This was The Rock’s first acting gig that wasn’t wrestling.</p>

<p>We start with a blood match, some kind of fighting MMA match. Something called “Tsunkatse”. Chakotay and Torres are REAL into it, which… I dunno if Federation officers SHOULD be, but okay. While here on shore leave, they’re excited to catch more Tsunkatse matches. Most of the crew is into shore leave either for that, or for other things. Neelix gets sunburnt. But Seven and Tuvok go to study a micronebula instead. We’ve always had “logic” characters in this series, but we’ve never had two at once. It’s really fun, they bounce off each other well.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/mOsaqxe.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>While studying the micronebula, a ship comes, disables their shuttle, and plants a bomb on it, blowing it the fuck up. Seven then wakes up right in front of fucking Weyoun. No, it’s some other alien, but it’s played by Jeffrey Combs, who is using the EXACT same voice he uses for Weyoun. One of the other aliens with him is also Martok. Damn, all star cast. This new guy, this ringleader of the blood fights, is like “I will treat Tuvok, who’s injuries are severe, if you fight for us”. So Seven complies, unhappily.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/pTGMzIa.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The rest of the crew goes to see the combat. Exciting, I wonder who’s gonna fight! :D Aaaaand there he is. Of course he can’t act, all he can do is that fuckin’ eyebrow thing he does.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/U4aqXIT.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Oh they’re so excited to see this guy throw people into the stands, ha ha, what a fun blood sport! Oh no, now that someone you KNOW is being forced to fight in the bloodsport now it’s not so enjoyable.</p>

<p>She and The Rock fight, and it’s pretty hot to see Seven kick ass. She keeps hesitating, because y’know, she doesn’t want to be there and doesn’t wanna hurt anyone. The Rock doesn’t feel the same way, and beats the hell of her after her hesitation. She loses, though this makes Not-Weyoun very happy, because so many people were REALLY excited to see a Borg get injured. Imagine how many would tune in to see a Borg die! Ooohoo, how exciting. There’s a Hirojan, the one played by Martok, who basically adopts her and tries to help her survive.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Xq55J6s.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>He has a tragic past, being captured with his son, who he never saw again. He might be imprinting him on her, though that doesn’t mean he goes easy on her.</p>

<p>The crew is now all “I can’t BELIEVE that this society is so into this gross bloodsport” which is very funny considering how into it they all were. Which y’know, is the point.</p>

<p>It’s time for the fight. The “Red Match”. Seven is NOT happy about having to kill someone to survive, but whatever it takes to survive. But who is her opponent? I think we know.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/4Wf460g.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>He wants a death his son would be proud of. If she won’t fight, then he’ll be forced to kill her.</p>

<p>What proceeds is a fight. The Hirojen ends up basically coercing her to fight by calling her imperfect. Meanwhile, Voyager comes and fires on the fighter ship, and beam over Tuvok. Buuut it looks like they might not be enough, until the Delta Flyer comes over to Big Damn Heroes the day. And just as Seven is going to kill the Hirojen (he begs for it, saying to not let her prey suffer), they’re teleported over. Both of them, safe and sound. The Hirogen goes to hunt for his son, but not before sharing one more moment with Seven. They’re lucky there was a way out. This time. And then she has one with Tuvok. They both like silence, but here they have a reason to speak.</p>
