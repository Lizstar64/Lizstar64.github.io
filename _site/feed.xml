<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p>IT’S BEEN A LOOOOONG ROOOOOAAAD</p>

<p>(these were 5 episodes from last week, and now 2 episodes to finish the season)</p>

<p><strong>Detained</strong> - ENT
8/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/rpEEFIb.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Mayweather wakes to find he’s in some kind of jail filled with Suliban. Holy shit, a Mayweather episode?! No way- oh, he’s here with the captain. Damn, okay, nevermind.</p>

<p>They’re taken to the warden who’s like “we found your shuttle near our military installation, and almost blew you up”. It was an honest misunderstanding, they were just studying the weird energy readings they found on it. No one is happy about this, but hey, it is what it is. Their hearing will be in 3 days and it should be fast. All they need to do is survive in the detention center for 3 days which is filled with Suliban POWs. Oh boy!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/X3usRWW.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Oh, maybe not POWs. That’s a child. Archer is like “Wtf you’re using KIDS for your war??” and he’s like “what the fuck no. You don’t know anything about us” and then he’s caught outside of curfew and is mistreated by the guards. Oh boy!!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/igoh5oa.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Archer finds the guy later and is like “Hey please tell me wtf is going on cause CLEARLY the Tandarens gave us a very biased viewpoint”. The Cabal attacked them 8 years ago, and the Tandarens put all the Suliban in their territory into internment camps. He thanks Archer for even listening, cause no one else will even bother. Archer is then taken to the leader of the internment camp, who WAS very friendly, but he’s not so much now that he knows Archer is talking to Suliban, AND he knows Archer knows things about Suliban. He threatens to keep him here indefinetely, and Archer is not at ALL willing to tell him anything cause holy shit, internment camps are evil, DID YOU KNOW THAT?</p>

<p>Good thing this is just fiction.</p>

<p>The Enterprise comes and is ready to sneak Archer and Mayweather out, but Archer refuses. Why? He’s going to save the Suliban, of course. He HAMMERS the fucking point by telling T’Pol about Japanese internment camps. Look, you need to be blunt for some topics. And this is one of em, I’m fine with it. It’s also VERY funny to me that they’re talking about this and how heinous it is, literally RIGHT when 9/11 happened and Freedom Fries were about to become a thing.</p>

<p>It IS unfortunate that we have ONE character in the Suliban group who’s a racist who hates the Humans cause they kinda look liek Tandarens. There’s racism on BOTH sides!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/aVh4xId.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Reed beams down disguised as a Sulliban, while Trip goes in guns fucking blazing. It’s time for a prison break!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ETPmZrO.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Nice line. The general is like “THESE PEOPLE HAVE NO RIGHTS, AND YOU JUST GAVE THEM 80 MORE SOLDIERS! THEY’LL JOIN THE CABAL CAUSE WE TREATED THEM SO BAD”. Gee I WONDER WHY THEY’D DO THAT? But no, Archer is like “You’re a fucking idiot”. He doesn’t even talk to the Suliban as they blast off, they just go their seperate ways, with Archer going “I think they’ll be alright”.</p>

<p>A little on the noise, but this one was good.</p>

<p><strong>Vox Sola</strong> - ENT
7.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/hip69J8.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The Enterprise insults some aliens in first contact and they run off. But not before some kind of goo moves from their ship to the Enterprise…</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/zgoSEBv.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Alex Mack is invading Enterprise!! Oh no!</p>

<p>We find out that Archer’s favorite sport, that he’s obsessed with, is water polo. That’s so fucking funny.</p>

<p>Anyways Alex Mack is causing some tech fuckery. Power’s going out, screens are showing the wrong thing. An engineer goes to figure out why the lights went out on D Deck and finds milk, goop, and webbing. And instead of immediately leaving he just keeps investigating. Dude.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/WAiKrm8.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Everyone goes to investigate and finds the crewmen in a web of some kind. You know, I just watched Alien. Anyways, it captures Trip and the Captain, and Reed has to run away, not before severing one of its tentacles. Phlox studies it and believes it MIGHT be intelligent. But they need to save those people so let’s go in blasting. Unfortunately, the alien has connected with their nervous systems so any amount of damage they do to it will hurt them. Apparently they’re all morphing into one creature in there. Weird.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/FXanqFY.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Hoshi and T’Pol are working together to learn its language, which is almost math-like. Just fucking kiss, you two.</p>

<p>Very good scene between Reed and Phlox. Reed is going to torture the organism’s apendage that they cut off, and Phlox is like “No, it shows signs of being intelligent life”. “Who cares? It might hurt the captain” “I don’t care”. While I agree with Phlox over Reed, obviously, this is a good character moment for both of them. Reed is a lot more pragmatic. Phlox not so much.</p>

<p>They find the aliens who stormed off earlier, who are like “oh yes, we were at that creatures’ homeworld, sorry. But first, apologize. You ate in public which is very rude to us”. Merriweather apologizes but is kinda bad with it. Come on man, its not THAT hard to believe that they have a cultural tabboo about this.</p>

<p>Reed basically has to invent forcefields to try and get in so they can communicate with this thing. Kinda rude of the Vulcans to not teach them about forcefields though.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/PiIMm8Z.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The creature sounds like its rubbing a bunch of balloons together. They communicate with it, tell it they’ll take it home, and it releases the Humans from its clutches. They take it to its homeworld, and alls good. It’s cute.</p>

<p><strong>Fallen Hero</strong> - ENT
7.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/hip69J8.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This episode starts in the most nutso way. T’Pol asks Archer if the Humans on Enterprise are getting enough sex. He’s like “what the FUCK?” “Well, I hear it eases tension for Humans.” To which Trip responds with “Not in MY experience”. Trip. Did you… just admit to being bad at sex??</p>

<p>Before they can go get laid though, they’re interrupted with orders to go pick up a Vulcan from a nearby planet. They HAVE to, NOW, then deliver her to a ship thats on its way in 3 days. She’s a famous ambassador. That’s all we know.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/cH1jNcR.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We find out fast that she’s being expelled for illegal activities. We don’t know what THAT is, but we’re still trying to be friendly and understanding. She’s SHOCKINGLY friendly for a Vulcan. She shakes hands, tries to understand Human culture, and is an ACTUALLY GOOD VULCAN ON EARLY ENTERPRISE. All the other Vulcans are weird assholes, she’s very friendly and understanding. But she IS an ambassador, this is how she SHOULD act. Though she’s also a criminal. T’Pol is extremely disappointed in her, and can’t hide her emotions about it.</p>

<p>They’re intercepted by a ship that’s like “Hi we’re here to take the ambassador back :)” and when Archer realizes he’s sus, they start opening fire. Enterprise is damaged but manages to run away.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/4GW6cF4.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/rxxhIzc.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Archer orders the ship to go back when the ambassador refuses to tell them wtf is going on. Vulcans are going to get VERY angry about this, but you know how he is with Vulcans. T’Pol and the ambassador have a talk about it. V’lar, the ambassador, is a very weird Vulcan. Her acting is different than any Vulcan I’ve seen.</p>

<p>She convinces T’Pol that it’s IMPERETIVE she not be sent back or she’ll be killed. Archer is still like “not enough” but when T’Pol BEGS, he relents.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/k81xThC.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>To escape the attacks, they push the engines further than they’ve ever been pushed. The Ambassador is like “Alright fuck this, give me to them, it’s not worth you all dying” but Archer was given orders so he’ll carry them out. He’s an honorable dude even if he’s grumpy at times. The Vulcan Ambassador wasn’t sure if she could trust Humans, but she finds them fascinating… But Archer’s gonna show why he’s out here.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/jQgqTXC.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Vulcan ships are very cool.</p>

<p>Anyways they get boarded and just have to buy ten minutes for the other ship to show up, so they pretend she gets put in the med bay, and they “kill her” (it’s a fake). Ha ha, gottem.</p>

<p>She announces that T’Pol and Archer seem to have a good burgeoning friendship, which poses well for their people, and then steps out. This episode was good too! Damn, good night tonight.</p>

<p><strong>Desert Crossing</strong> - ENT
6/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/yHx0ruE.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Enterprise is STILL heading to Risa when they’re interrupted by a distress call. They save Clancy Brown who sounds VERY Lex Luthory.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/J7qHn7V.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>He invites Archer to a party on his planet. It’s a desert planet, and they don’t really WANT to but they don’t want to offend him. MAybe they should invite the Vulcan, she’s from a desert planet- oh, no, Trip? Okay. Why not.</p>

<p>Trip and Archer have a good time. Eating blood soup and testicals, and playing Desert Lacross. It’s a very Top Gun scene. Everything seems good, but then T’Pol is contacted by a government official who’s like “you’re in danger. That man is a terrorist”. Uh oh.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/dV79Pay.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>When they find out, their host is like “Look, you’re being lied to.” They’re a lower class culture in this society and are being mistreated, and after ten years of trying to do it legally through protests and courts, are now attacking them and resorting to terrorism. “They call us TERRORISTS!” No, dog. You ARE a terrorist. Like, that’s the definition of it. You may in the right, but that doesn’t matter. It’s still terrorism.</p>

<p>Archer doesn’t handle this well. He was led here under false pretenses, and this guy wants him to help them fight a war. And why? Because he heard about Archer from the Suliban he released. A made up fictitious account that’s blown out of proportion, mind you. If there’s one good thing about Enterprise, they’re good at continuity. Anything can relate to anything else.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/HosUVri.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The place they’re being kept at is being attacked, and they decide they’ll be safer in the desert. That seems…. I dunno. Deserts are scary. It doesn’t go well, especially since there’s also shuttles out looking for them, because the government has just decided they’re collaborating with the terrorists.</p>

<p>This episode has the longest unbroken shot in the entirety of the Star Trek franchise. Trip and Archer are hiding in an old abandoned shack, and Archer is trying to keep Trip awake so he doesn’t pass out with heat stroke, cause that’s bad for you. Almost four straight minutes of them acting tired and dying.</p>

<p>With the help of the original guy who got us into this mess, they manage to sneak a shuttle down to the planet and rescue the two of them. The episode ends with Archer admitting his cause is worth fighting for, but that’s not why they’re out there, and they go their seperate ways.</p>

<p><strong>Two Days and Two Nights</strong> - ENT
7.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/cigexKX.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Part three of the Journey to Risa trilogy, no joke, that’s what Memory Alpha says. But they FINALLY made it to Risa and are gonna be vacationing for two days. Archer is kinda unhappy he’s vacationing, but T’Pol is basically forcing him to. Plus they all drew lots. He needs a vacation. Thankfully, nothing bad is gonna happen at all while he’s down there! And back on Enterprise, Plox is starting his hibernation. Ohhh, let’s just STACK the Dangerous Situations on top of each other! Luckily, Archer is going down with Porthos in the shuttle, so we know nothings gonna happen to him. They’ll NEVER endanger Porthos.</p>

<p>I know this isn’t going to happen but please just let this be them chilling on the planet.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/npy9zfG.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>T’Pol gifts Archer a copy of the teachings of Surak to “relax”, which is VERY funny. He also sees a girl with a dog in a villa across the way. Ooooh, romaaaance?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/NSV9Ki0.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Speaking of romance, we gotta keep pretending Reed is straight so he and Trip (who is actually straight, way, way too straight) standing around in a bar creepily oggling women. There’s jokes about “is that even a woman” which oh, what fun. Meanwhile Hoshi meets an alien with a weird language, and he offers to help her learn some of it. Okay, calling it. Hoshi is fucking that alien. Archer is MAYBE gonna fuck the girl he’s with, but might decide he would want something deeper. And Reed and Trip are going to desperately attempt to get laid but will absolutely not.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/v2t7Yb9.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Oh nevermind, they’ll just get robbed by some shapeshifters pretending to be call girls looking for sex. Why are they introducing so many shapeshifters?? I feel like this could create some problems for the lore.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/sbrkpTP.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Mayweather gets injured and has an allergic reaction to the medicine so they have to wake Phlox up. Phlox when he’s not gotten enough sleep acts like he’s drunk, and it’s actually VERY funny. He’s calling everyone captain, stumbling around, going “WE NEED BLOOD WORMS, MAXIMUM WARP”, it’s great.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/0Ofjb3b.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Archer’s new girlfriend is very VERY insistant that Archer knows info about the Cabal. Archer is sus and scans her, turns out she’s a Tandaran. He assumes Grat, the Tandaran from that earlier episode, sent her. She knocks him out with a Spy Weapon, says she can’t have him “interfere”, and then leaves. They all make it back to the ship, Hoshi having gotten laid, Trip and Reed covered in gunk and exhausted from having to break out of bonds, and Archer pensive. And it just ends. PRetty good over all. A  bit glad it didn’t move into some greater bigger plot thread.</p>

<p><strong>Shockwave</strong> - ENT
7/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/uQBARBa.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>While visiting a mining colony, they visit in a shuttle. The atmosphere is filled with shit that can explode, so they turn off their plasma ducts. Uh, but the atmosphere fucking explodes anyway. The entire colony is wiped out. 3600 colonists, dead. Everything shows that their stuff didn’t malfunction, but that doesn’t change the fact that there’s a bunch of dead people down there. They followed the protocols, hell they went above and beyond, but that doesn’t help either.</p>

<p>T’Pol is like “He is acting illogical” because Archer is EXTREMELY upset and blames himself for all thsoe deaths. Phlox is like “are you fucking kidding me”. Archer gets orders to go back home, the mission is cancelled. The Vulcans will use this as an excuse to delay Humans for another 20-30 years. Archer’s just letting it happen.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/qxdN6Mu.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>T’Pol is the person who knocks Archer out of his dispondency. It works because a VULCAN of all people is going “No, you Humans are ready. I’ll talk to my people. Will you talk to your’s?”. And then, when he goes to bed… he suddenly finds himself in the past. He’s EXTREMELY sus. Everything is EXACTLY how it was just before he boarded Enterprise, just before the first episode.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/KESlahx.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Hey look, it’s Daniels! Remember him? He was fucking killed. That hasn’t changed. He’s like “Yeah that DID happen but hey, I’m fine now. Let’s not make a big deal out of this.” He took Archer back into the past so that he could tell him exactly what happened. Archer gets a crash course in temporal techno babble, and when he gets back to the present, he knows EXACTLY how to prove they’re innocent. Whoever temporally fucked with the timeline made it seem like Enterprise killed a bunch of people to try and get them out of the picture.</p>

<p>Archer then goes a mile a minute telling everyone EXACTLY how to fix things. No one questions things cause they trust him, but they’re all visibly weirded out. They raid a Suliban stealth cruiser and get proof that they’re innocent, and that it was the Suliban who did all this.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/WYKiNDT.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Silik is still talking to this random shadowy dude, which is very, VERY Star Wars still but whatever. I sure hope we found out what thats all about soon :)</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/7yBCzT1.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>On their way home, they find themselves surrounded by cloaked meatballs. Silik says “come with me or I blow everyone up”. Archer puts T’Pol in command, and goes with him. Archer basically does the Sisko “I’m going, but I’m not gone. I’ll be back soon” thing. But not quite as effective. He goes… and then disappears. No one knows where he went. Silik is not impressed, and orders Enterprise blown up.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ThylDMW.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Daniels grabbed Archer and took him to the 31st centry, like his bosses told him to. But uh… turns out that was a Bad Idea, and now the ENTIRE FUTURE IS DEAD because of this. And there’s no way to get back. They’re stranded. The End.</p>

<p>CLIFF HANGER TIME!</p>

<p>Interesting setup for a 2 parter. Let’s hope it ends well. I also wish I gave more of a shit about the Temporal Cold War.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="Enterprise" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">LizstarTrek - Enterprise Season 2 episodes 1 -</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/lizstartrek/2025/10/19/LizstartrekEnt2-1.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="LizstarTrek - Enterprise Season 2 episodes 1 -" /><published>2025-10-19T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-10-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/lizstartrek/2025/10/19/LizstartrekEnt2-1</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/lizstartrek/2025/10/19/LizstartrekEnt2-1.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ouHMzRZ.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p>IT’S BEEN A LOOOOONG ROOOOOAAAD</p>

<p><strong>Shockwave Part 2</strong> - ENT
6/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/BHbF1JO.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Daniels is NOT handling his world being blown up very well. Why do all these time travel cops snap and break the SECOND something bad happened with time travel? You’d think they’d be PREPARED for this shit. Remember the guy from Voyager who became a screaming raving hobo telling everyone about time travel after being stranded in the past? Idiots.</p>

<p>Enterprise is taken by the Suliban, who’re holding everyone hostage while they’re searching for Archer. Trip tries to fight them even thoguh they have guns on him and say “we will kill people if you resist”. I think I’ve realized what Trip reminds me of. He’s like a Chihuaha in a Human body. He yaps angrily at everything even though he knows it’ll do nothing and gets himself into danger trying to fight people he has no chance or hurting.</p>

<p>“We learned how to do time travel in high school” says Daniels. Why? Why did you do that? That seems very, very bad.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/CnHX1Zm.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Rick Berman, I’m gonna NEED you to keep your fucking “tie a woman up and torture her” fetish out of Star Trek for one fucking show, please, I FUCKING beg of you.</p>

<p>This is not beating the “part 2s are usually worse than the 1st part” allegations.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/WqR5MD0.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>T’Pol is drugged out of her mind, when Archer manages to communicate with her. He’s doing a big Wizard of Oz thing with her, and needs her help, but she’s VERY zonked. But next time we see her she’s fine and working towards helping so I guess we’ll just forget that. Wow, there was no reason to have that “drug T’Pol and torture her” scene from earlier? No way! Rick Berman should be arrested.</p>

<p>They then force Hoshi to sneak through the shafts in a tanktop. Usually I’d love an episode of people Die Harding through the space ship, but this has the stink of Horny Berman all over it, as Hoshi moans her way through the engineering shafts, freaking out cause of claustrophobia. It’s way, WAY too Horny. And then she rips her shirt and gets naked. Rick Berman should be tried for war crimes.</p>

<p>Do you remember how Vulcans are super physically strong? Anyways cause T’Pol is a weak little girl she’s used as bait and dragged off easily by two big strong men. Rick Berman should be executed for war crimes.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/b8ZUkM5.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Reed is captured while trying to take soemthing from Daniels’ locker, as the Humans sabatoge the warp core and prepare the ship to blow the fuck up. The Suliban take the thing from Reed but run away. Turns out they just faked a warp core explosion to get control back. Meanwhile, Silik is trying to use the thing he took from Reed to talk to Emperor Palpatine, and then turns out OH NO, IT’S ACTUALLY ARCHER, who jumps through time and decks him in the fucking face.</p>

<p>Archer takes Silik hostage and returns. Ambassador Soval, the Vulcan ambassador, still is like “You are a menace to this quadrant and must be stopped, I don’t care if you’re innocent”. Why did they assign an ambassador to Earth who CLEARLY hates Humans? Anyways, T’Pol speaks up and calls him out, defending Archer. Her speaking up STUNS everyone, and is probably what saved it. Enterprise continues.</p>

<p>Neli: “Okay. I didn’t hate the moments that weren’t offensive”</p>

<p>I couldn’t say it better myself. Good concepts and fun moments, especially the T’Pol bit at the end, is quite good. And then Berman’s spunk is all OVER this from him masturbating to it.</p>

<p><strong>Carbon Creek</strong> - ENT
10/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ouHMzRZ.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Trip, Archer, and T’Pol are celebrating her being on the ship for a full year. Impressive since the last longest time serving on a Human ship was 10 days. While having dinner, Archer asks why T’Pol was visiting Carbon Creek, a random mining town in Pennsylvania in 1957. She tells the story, and it becomes a Story Episode of her tlaking about her ancestors who crash landed on Earth hundreds of years ago. Her great grandmother, specifically. Her Gram Gram, T’Mir, is played by T’Pol’s actor, a classic just like when Voyager did it with Janeway’s ancestor. The seed is strong, I suppose.</p>

<p>Anyways T’Mir and another Vulcan go into town, steal some clothes, and try to blend in, just to try and get food, cause they’ll starve otherwise. They’re bad at blending in but it’s basically just two nerds with autism. Now it IS 1957, but people are taking it generally in stride. At least neither of the Vulcans are black, could you imagine?</p>

<p>T’Mir’s associate, Mestral, gambles on Pool and gets them some food. Trip feels like this is something out of the Twilight Zone but I’m kinda digging it so far. They get some odd jobs around town. T’Mir is annoyed at the situation, wants to avoid Humans, and thinks they’ll just blow each other up. Mestral appreciates the Humans, thinks them full of empathy and compassion, and expects they’ll do great things in the future. He’s also kind of a Humaboo, and is a fan of I Love Lucy. Also fun since I Love Lucy is so integral to Star Trek existing, its a cute reference.</p>

<p>Mestral also has very big Data vibes. This actor totally watched some Brent Spiner before this.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Qpew3Hn.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Anyways turns out Mestral is sneaking out to have dates with a bartender in town. T’Mir is NOT happy and tries to stop him but like, what power does she have? Yes she’s his commanding officer, but y’know. But T’Mir eventually starts to come around. There’s a kid who’s a bright, friendly kid around town. She connects to him a bit.</p>

<p>Some Humans get trapped in a mine. Mestral steals a weapon to try and break them out. T’Mir is like “They only live at most 70 years so why even bother to extend their lives for a bit longer?” and he’s like “it’s called compassion? They’re my friends, and I’m going to help them.” T’Mir comes around and helps him though, guiding him through so he can do it safely without being caught.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/I7DNuc0.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They get a message. They’re being rescued in three days. T’Mir’s young friend wishes her luck moving back home. Turns out he can’t go to college after all, he wasn’t accepted. He needs money, but they’re just a poor bar family. T’Mir spends the next few days taking a train into the city…. where she shows a big corpo bro fucking VELCRO, then donates all the money. Fantastic.</p>

<p>Mestral doesn’t want to leave. He’s fascinated by this species. And Maggie. And her breasts. But mostly their species. So they pretend he died in the crash, and then they blast off. Trip is like “omg he was around for 30 presidents afterwards and no one caught it???” Do you imagine 80 years later, Mestral was watching the TV and saw Trump won re-election and was like “I should have gone back to Vulcan”</p>

<p>Trip and Archer don’t believe her, but then she goes back to her quarters and pulls out a purse left by her gram gram.</p>

<p>This was fantastic. Best episode of Enterprise so far, absolutely. It had the Star Trek optimism, actually good well-written Vulcans, funny good writing. It was just… fantastic.</p>

<p><strong>Minefield</strong> - ENT
5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/vug49cO.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Reed has a dinner with the Captain and is very awkward about it. The Captain is like “Dog, chill” then they’re called up to do some routine exploration when suddenly the fucking ship explodes.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/IYRaGLC.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Something just up and blew up a chunk of the ship. 17 Casualties, including Hoshi, but no fatalities. I’m STUNNED honestly. Turns out they’re in a mine field filled with a bunch of cloaked mines. One latches onto the ship, and Reed goes out into space to detatch it. Meanwhile, a green ship uncloaks, shoots a warning shot, and yells in some language they can’t understand, because Hoshi has a concussion.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/HgxLLpZ.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>While Reed is trying to defuse the bomb, a spike comes and impales Reed right in the leg. Foam stops his suit from bleeding oxygen, but things aren’t lookin’ good. Archer goes out to help him, give him some anesthetic, and has to shut it down with Reed’s advice now.</p>

<p>Hoshi translates just enough t o find out… it’s some group called the Romalin Star Empire? T’Pol corrects her. It’s pronounced Romulan. Holy shit, actual first contact with Romulans? This is what we WANTED from Enterprise, not any of that Temporal Cold War shit.</p>

<p>Reed and Archer have some hearts to heart. Reed admits he just feels it’s not right to fraternize with a superior officer. He’s kinda a boring dude, honestly, right down to it. He’s also just kinda unhappy with Archer cause he thinks Archer should be a shitty, bad captain. Reed has bad opinions.</p>

<p>The Romulans, now that Hoshi can translate the language, are like “Get the fuck out of here. Just detatched that hull plating, kill your crewman, and leave.” Ahh, Romulans. As unforgiving of any others existing as always. Anyways the mine will explode if they try and disarm it like this. So Reed tries to kill himself so that they’ll just knock off the plate off. He’s like “JUST BE A GOOD (read: bad) CAPTAIN FOR ONCE AND LET ME DIE A HERO”. Reed is a fucking weirdo.</p>

<p>Archer comes up with a big dumb plan. He cuts the thing, and it explodes. They use plating as shields and protect themselves, launching away from the blast. Absolutely nuts. But it works, the end.</p>

<p>They probably should have just cut through his leg. Anyways, I found this mostly boring. Reed is just kinda boring.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="Enterprise" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 191</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/10/17/OOCY191.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 191" /><published>2025-10-17T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-10-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/10/17/OOCY191</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/10/17/OOCY191.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/vkYvXpb.png" alt="'" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>So a while ago, I made a post about Megami Tensei. I said I was trying to beat it but gave up cause it was kinda shitty and annoying, but I was playing Megami Tensei II and was enjoying it. That shows how behind on these I am, that was early August, it’s now the middle of October. I’ve actually mastered Megami Tensei 1 btw. Expect that post sometime soon. If you missed that post and are like “wait, but I don’t know what happened in Megaten 1” don’t worry. It really doesn’t matter much.</p>

<p>Megami Tensei 2 blows Megaten 1 out of the water so fucking hard it’s left orbit. Megaten 1 was frustrating, outdated, and annoying. Megaten 2 is one of the best retro RPGs I’ve ever played. The quality increase is frankly stunning.</p>

<p>Megaten 1 was a direct sequel to the books where you played as a nerd who invented a Devil Summoning program. That doesn’t matter now. This is a different story, kind of. It’s still a direct sequel. You’ll see. You get an intro telling you the world exploded in nuclear hellfire and almost everyone is fucking dead, and devils rule the world now. Well that bites. And then you name yourself and your female companion, much like Megaten 1, but also some other friend you have. Anyways here’s the game:</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/9XmMDBj.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>It plays MUCH differently from Megaten 1, huh? It’s a top down almost Dragon Quest style RPG. Huh, this map looks familiar. Wait, it IS the same map from Megaten 1! Weird. You wander around and are told you need to do a thing to release a spirit. Okay, cool. You and your ladyfriend wander around, gain levels, and can recruit demons. The demon recruiting in this is a LOT better than in Megaten 1. In 1 it was all random. Here you have some control over it. It’s still random, but you can learn to affect the random percentages and make it easier to befriend demons.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the tower, you defeat the minotaur boss much like MT1, and then release the spirit… who’s name is Pazuzu, and he tells you that this game was made by the creator of the demon summoning program, you two are the chosen ones, he’s working for God, and you must help him defeat Bael, an evil Demon who’s trying to take over Tokyo. What???</p>

<p>THAT’S RIGHT. The entire first hour or so of the game is a fucking <em>game inside a game</em>. You’re actually some random dork in an underground vault, alongside your other friend you named at the start. You’re playing a game Nakajima, the character from the first game, made of his adventures. And then you’re sent out of the game and into the “real world”.</p>

<p>I really cannot stress how cool this is, and how EXTREMELY it sets this game apart from the first. In the first, you’re given NO plot. You are dropped into one giant maze and that’s it. Here, they’re doing a fucking framing device. This is beyond impressive for 1990.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Oc13SE2.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Anyways from this point on, the game actually jumps back to the MT1 style movement of the first person dungeon crawling, and the Dragon Questy top down exploration when you’re on the overworld. You explore old vaults and broken buildings in first person. Along the way you’re accompanied NOT by the girl you named at the start, but instead your friend. But everyone’s talking about this Witch of Tokyo, and she has the same name of the girl from the game. Huh, weird. Pazuzu actually tells you she’s betrayed their cause and is siding with Bael to destroy humanity.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/8yObWIo.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Okay, this is where the game takes a bit of a hit for me. But even with this mistep, I think it’s impressive. I’ll explain. You go to take on this Witch, and have a conversation with her. Now, if you say the wrong things, you can <em>softlock your game</em>. You NEED to side with her to continue the game, otherwise you’re fucked. This is… bad. Very bad. And the dialogue, at least for the translation I used, is slightly stilted and hard to follow what they’re trying to say.</p>

<p>Despite that… I think what they’re TRYING here is actually very good?? It’s a good early RPG plot twist. She basically tells you “You’re being lied to by Pazuzu. I’m not working for Bael, and Pazuzu doesn’t have Humanity’s best interests in heart. Join me instead, and we can save Humanity”.</p>

<p>If you’ve played Shin Megami Tensei, this is going to be very familiar to you. Those games have an alignment system, which goes from Lawful to Neutral to Chaotic. This is basically setting up the start of that. You can’t be Chaotic in this game and side with Bael or anything, but it’s setting up a lawful (side with Pazuzu and God) or Neutral (side with Humanity and escape the cycle these two sides are forcing you into). It’s VERY good conceptually, but isn’t told perfectly. And honestly, that’s just a side effect of it being an NES game from 1990. Mother 1 has the exact same problem, an amazing idea and story that’s a bit stimied by its Bits.</p>

<p>Anyways after siding with the Witch, your friend is like “wtf, but we’re God’s Chosen??? We’re the main characters, you can’t do that! Well, next time we meet, we’ll be enemies” and goes off to become the Dark Hero you gotta fight throughout the game. And then you go around, collecting items and doing side quests to get further so you can defeat both Bael AND Pazuzu, then eventually the big G himself. And not only that, but you know who sides with you, the Big Good of this game who’s been rebelling against the evils of God this entire time? That’s right. Fucking LUCIFER.</p>

<p>When I first played this game I was like “I know the games later have you fight the Christian God, but there’s no way this game does that right?” Uh, no. That’s the plot twist. God is actually just as morally reprehensible as anyone else you’ve been fighting, and must be stopped. Fucking kill him. You get Lucifer on your team and <em>kill god</em>. It’s genuinely <em>nuts</em>. I imagine Atlus talking to a localizer like “can we bring this over to America” and that guy exploding in pure shock. This would have caused <strong>riots</strong> in America if it got on store shelves in 1990, because it’s not subtle, and it doesn’t mix its message. A God that allows these things to happen is doing it on purpose, and must be stopped, and any being that’s trying to rebel against Him for Humanity’s sake is a good guy.</p>

<p>It IS a little weird, considering Lucifer is the final boss and big bad of Megami Tensei 1, but I think by now you’ve realized this has very little to do with Megami Tensei 1 and is basically its own game. This is, in my opinion not Megami Tensei 2, but is really Shin Megami Tensei 0.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZDkYS8tqHyg?si=UzUf1nHFKzl_bcqr" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>By the way, here’s the final boss music. It fucking WHIPS.</p>

<p>That’s one thing about this game I haven’t mentioned yet, it’s aesthetics are INCREDIBLE? One of the best looking and sounding NES games ever, frankly. Probably the best looking RPG??? Look, I love FF3 and DQ4 a lot. A looooooot. But this looks fucking fantastic. And the monster design is SO COOL.</p>

<p>Also the protagonist designs are RAD. In the middle of the game you’re collecting these items to open up a gateway to Hell so you can go beat the shit out of Bael, and one of them is in this giant mouth. You stick your hand in to grab it, and it fucking bites your hand off. You then have “one handed” as a status effect for a little bit, which drains your health and has you hit for nothing, but then THIS happens:</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/sc0gnRu.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>This is one of the sickest mother fucking character designs I’ve ever seen. Look at this dude with his keyboard computer robo-hand and big-ass cape. It’s SO FUCKING COOL. This is WHAT I WANT TO LOOK LIKE. GIVE ME AN 80s ROBO COMPUTER ARM. BITE MY FUCKING ARM OFF.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/FVWgsaz.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Your partner’s design is no slouch either, frankly. All the aesthetics are really on point. This is a grungy, shitty post apocalyptic world, and you gotta make a place to live in it.</p>

<p>I think I could go on, but I don’t need to. I’ve sung this game’s praises enough. From the amazing plot twists and set pieces to the primitive but impressive attempt at a story, this is one of the absolute best NES RPGs. I’d put it right up there with the likes of DQ 3 and 4, Final Fantasy 3, and Mother. It’s still got its rough retro edges, but it doesn’t get much better than this on this console. What an AMAZING glow up after Megaten 1.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="NES" /><category term="Retro Games" /><category term="RPG" /><category term="Megaten" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 190</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/10/13/OOCY190.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 190" /><published>2025-10-13T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-10-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/10/13/OOCY190</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/10/13/OOCY190.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/LHN3FFS.png" alt="'" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>On a whim, I decided to play this. This is a Game Gear homebrew Solitaire game based on Shenzhen I/O, a Zachtronics game. If you don’t know, Zachtronics is known for their Solitaire variants. And this is one of them, just ported to the Game Gear.</p>

<p>It’s a little confusing at first, considering it’s an entirely new variant of Solitaire with all new cards, but once you understand it, it’s honestly a pretty easy variant. You’ve got three kinds of cards. Number cards, which you need to get into the top right three slots. They stack like usual number cards in Solitaire do, and must be stacked in increasing value from 1. Normal stuff. Then you have the Dragon Cards. Claws, paws, and hoofs. These are put in the top left three slots. They  can’t be placed on any other card in the main playing area. And then the snep card, which is a flower in the original. It’s a “free” card that can be put in the top middle slot. Aaaand that’s it.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/rMeQceM.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>The game can’t have the entire play field on the screen at once, so you gotta scroll left and right. But that’s it. It’s solitaire. Simple and easy. Zachtronics makes good solitaire variants, check them out.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Game Gear" /><category term="Homebrew" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">LizstarTrek - Strange New Worlds Season 3 episode 6-10</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/lizstartrek/2025/10/12/LizstartrekSNW3-2.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="LizstarTrek - Strange New Worlds Season 3 episode 6-10" /><published>2025-10-12T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-10-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/lizstartrek/2025/10/12/LizstartrekSNW3-2</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/lizstartrek/2025/10/12/LizstartrekSNW3-2.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/nVITuMH.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p>This is the third season of SNW, finally coming out. We’re gonna watch an episode of this once a week until we finish, alongside Voyager, cause it’s coming out y’know, one a week. Yay! I love SNW!</p>

<p><strong>Through the Lens of Time</strong> - SNW
5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/N8mQara.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This season is going really hard on the romance drama, which is starting to get mostly tiring for me. But it’s ALSO pushing this new nurse guy, Dana. He’s SO excited and happy to be here. This guy is SO fucking dead. He’s got the voice over and it’s really pushing him, he’s so fucked. It also seems like he was brought in secretly as a third wheel so that thigns aren’t TOO awkward between Spock and Korby as they do some kind of dig.</p>

<p>Ortegas’ brother is also here! He’s recording stuff for a documentary, it seems, and is also invited to this mission, which SEEMS to be an archaeological dig on a sacred site. He’s also getting romance vibes with Uhura. They’re really trying to hook EVERYONE up this season aren’t they? Though Pelia the Warpcore Witch also seems to be real into him. And I like that, cause it’s funny.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/p5JfYBa.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They all enter some kind of temple, after Chapel does some kind of thing to gain entry. They IMMEDIATELY find corpses and Spock is like “okay, protocol tells is we need to leave now”. Korby gets pissy and refuses, and Chapel, who’s in charge of the mission, sides with him cause he’s her girlfriend. There’s also a lot of tension cause of the whole Spock x Chapel thing. See, this is why everyone shouldn’t just fuck. Use the holodeck to fuck- wait. We already had an episode about how that’s a bad idea at this time.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ypNSSmn.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>New Kid, who’s name is Gamble, acts like a TOS red shirt and randomly touches shit. Anyways, woah, New Kid gets his fucking eyes exploded cause things are actually super dangerous in here! Looks like Spock was right, what a mother fucking shock! The native living with them sees something else, freaks the fuck out, and tries to run away, and is vaporized. But we have so many things we could learn here!!! Korby was ABSOLUTELY going to just fucking die because he wasn’t being careful enough if others didn’t die before him, frankly. Why was he SO SURE that he had to do this dig RIGHT THE FUCK NOW? “I’ve waited all my life for this!” Yeah dude, but you’re like, 33. This temple isn’t going anywhere. Put down that fucking idiot ball, right now, mister!</p>

<p>They get split up, as if it couldnt’ get any worse, and are in different rooms, but able to communicate. This now turns into a split room puzzle game escape room. Seems to be the same room but also not, seperate dimensions. They can still communicate though. Why? I dunno, bad writing?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/x4jYCCp.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The Eyeball Regenerator, which apparently exists, is not working. New Kid’s brain is also registering as braindead. New episode name: Gamble’s Brain. Gamble is also acting Kinda Sus now. Hmm.</p>

<p>Ten minutes ago, Gamble’s eyes exploded. Now, Spock is saying how Korby is not being safe enough and not taking any precautions, and then he TAKES A FUCKING VISOR OFF OF A DEAD ALIEN AND PUTS IT ON HIS EYEBALLS AND USES IT TO LOOK AT THINGS. WHAT THE FUCK, SPOCK? I’m starting to think this episode might just not be well written.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/HLyV7Ze.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Patel, who I remind you is now half Gorn, meets Gamble, and starts speaking in tongues. Gamble does the same, and they proceed to beat the shit out of each other. Gamble also murders someone in the scuffle. After he’s captured, he just breaks through the force fields and kills more red shirts. Damn, this episode has a body count.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/hp0x8tF.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Pelia shoots Gamble in the back, releasing the ancient dimensional alien inside of him. Scotty then captures it in a Pokeball and tosses it up into the transporter. He locks it in the transport buffer, until they can figure out what to do with it. There’s no WAY that’ll backfire!!!</p>

<p>Pelia has a big discussion about ancient evil, which turns out to be her mugging for the documentary. Okay, that was funny. I was like “wow that’s very on the nose- oh okay, that’s good”. I do like Pelia. As M’Benga calls Gamble’s parents to tell them about their son, the Enterprise computer screens flash alien text. Wow, I knew it’d backfire but THAT fast.</p>

<p>I think my judgement of this will depend on if and when it goes anywhere, but I feel it was poorly written. Something was off and the pacing was bad.</p>

<p><strong>The Sehlat Who Ate Its Tail</strong> - SNW
8/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/iXkfagX.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>What a weird episode title.</p>

<p>Anyways, Kirk is on the Ferragut, and he’s bored as fuck. His captain, V’rel is a hot Vulcan bitch who does everything By The Book, and Kirk wants a shakeup. Be careful what you wish for, Kirk. They disturb a disturbance in the crust of a planet they’re observing, which turns out to be the planet fucking exploding. The captain and a lot of the crew is taken out. Comms are down, so there’s no way to communicate.</p>

<p>Enterprise comes to help out, a team beaming over to try and help. Kirk is in charge, V’Rel is alive but injured. Turns out there was some kind of gravitational beam that blew up the planet, though it’d take a ship so much larger than anything else on record. Uhura sets up comms with the Enterprise, who orders everyone to evacuate. Fair. La’an and some of the critically wounded beam over first. Before they can do anything else though, THIS happens!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/nV2aKch.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>A giant fucking thing comes and literally eats the Enterprise. La’an explains she thinks it’s the Eater of Worlds. A giant ancient scavenger ship. Ghost story. Interesting. You’d think something like this would be more than just a Legend, but whatever works. Kirk refuses to leave people on the ship, and demands Scotty make miracles. This is actually the first time Kirk and Scotty are even working together. Since Spock is here too, as acting 2nd in command, with Uhura too, it’s practically a TOS reunion party. Just like, a pre-union.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/2J7mGnt.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The things in charge of this giant Scavenger ship appear to have boarded the Enterprise, and are just fucking Big Daddies.</p>

<p>Kirk is making bad decisions. He ignores all his advisors, and the ship explodes. Not like, fully, it’s just dead in the water. He ignored Scotty, and he’s pushed it too far. He gets angry and refuses to listen to any other advices. He storms off. They decide he needs someone to help him through this, someone with a less emotional style to calm him. Time for the start of Spock x Kirk!!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/FJxOfv8.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We get to see Pelia’s quarters. It’s absolutely incredible. She digs in a box for some ancient junk. She pulls out a mother fucking Atari. Holy hell. I want to see her video game collection. Communications are being jammed, so her plan? Wire the enterprise with ancient cables and use old-ass phones. That’s honestly fantastic.</p>

<p>We learn what the title of this episode means. The Sehlat that Ate Its Tail is a Vulcan idiom, similar to “the dog that caught the car”. Someone hunting after a thing, then… now what? Kirk, going after leadership, now he’s stuck and frozen. It’s cute. Anyways, Spock and Kirk have a heart to heart, and it helps. He comes back with a new plan. Make their ship look REAL tasty to the scavengers so they’ll come biting, then make them regreat it.</p>

<p>Back on the Enterprise, the Big Daddies refuse to kill Pike after it knocks his helmet off. Weird. Strange.</p>

<p>“I haven’t done this since I was a roadie for the dead!” “…Your species can communicate with dead people?” Holy shit, I LOVE Pelia. When they actually do things with her she’s so funny.</p>

<p>This episode is not doing a LOT with Pike, but it’s doing more than the rest of this season’s done. He’s the CAPTAIN, and he’s barely got any love this season. He’s the best character on this show. Very fun moments with him. “Take a step back, this might blow up.” “Captain, if it does, it’ll blow up the entire engineering section.” “…A very large step back, then?” I love you, Pike.</p>

<p>Spock manages to hit the aliens where they hurt and blow them upm just as the Enterprise escapes.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/lQm5m80.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We find out the Scavengers were Human. On the side of the ship, they find “XCV-100”, which is a reference to a classic Ship concept. Apparently many years ago, some Humans built a ship to escape an environmental collapse of Earth. But then the ship disappeared, never to be heard from again. But how did they go from THAT, to whatever they became? It’s not explained.</p>

<p>I’m not really sure I like the ending all that much? The big twist? But the lessons Pike imparts to Kirk in the end are good, at least, and the action and jokes are good. It’s like, a solid season 1 or 2 episode.</p>

<p><strong>What is Starfleet</strong> - SNW
2/10</p>

<p>So for the past season, we’ve seen Beto, Ortegas’ brother, recording a documentary about Starfleet. And now this episode IS that documentary. We get to see this guy’s documentary he made about what Starfleet is. And you know what? It kinda sucks.</p>

<p>We’ll see if, by the end of this, it’s… intentional. But it feels like a first year film student trying to Do Something. To Say Something. But it’s honestly stunning how bad the editing is. That HAS to be the intention, but I don’t care if something is intentionally bad if it’s bad to watch.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ePXmjB1.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>It jumps between scenes with weird camera angles and bad shots. None of the scenes flow together, with the different members of the crew talking about random inane bullshit. Apparently we get a Spock Self Harm backstory. When he was a kid he tried to carve the human half out of him with a knife. Joy. Glad THAT’S canon now.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/J9er1s6.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Whatever this thing is, it’s pretty.</p>

<p>We see them go do… something in some war. It’s not super well explained. Every character feels weirdly out of character. I THINK that’s the point? They’re being misrepresented for some kid’s school project. Pike is angry and lashing out about the cameras being around. M’Benga is represented as a violent shady war criminal. He tells Uhura her friend is dead, just so he can get her reaction on camera. Oh yeah, just ask your sister on camera, who’s knee deep in PTSD, how her hand is doing after 3/5ths of it was dissolved in Gorn Goo.</p>

<p>Neli, the friend I watch these with, describes it as “them trying to do ‘Faranheit 911’. A kind of shockcumentary that is so up its own ass and full of itself. Yeah.</p>

<p>Also the camera shakes around so much this is so extremely hard to follow and hurts to look at. Beto is… bad at being a documentarian. I’ve said that a lot, but his camera work is ass, as ass as his editing. Why was THIS GUY given full open access to record anything on the flagship of the Federation?? It’d be like giving Uwe Boll unlimited access to do whatever he wants.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/sqdG641.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Is he RECORDING PEOPLE WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE for this documentary??? I doubt that’s legal in the Federation. At least it seems like everyone on this ship is kind of sick to death of Beto. Uhura tells him to fuck off after he asks her some self pretentious shit about colonizers. At least we know where THAT romance plot is going. I swear, if they STILL try to push a romance with them after this episode, it’ll be even worse than the Worf x Dax bullshit.</p>

<p>So there’s some kinda plot about a society at war with another society, and they’re doing some kind of project to make this giant space amoebas into beasts of war. The neural implant they’re using is torturing it, and it breaks so it can’t be controlled anymore, and it lashes out. They communicate with it telepathically, find out it can’t control itself, and they help it commit suicide. That’s the plot. Honestly, not terrible? I would have liked to watch a normal-ass Trek episode about it. Because the first half is whatever hte fuck was going on there, weird propaganda shit, and this second half is actually Trek-like and kinda okay, but it’s COMPLETELY ruined because I was so extremely checked out. Also the editing and camera work are still fucking ass.</p>

<p>And it just ends. Here’s some comments from a video that put the ending out there clearly:</p>

<p>“The space moth killed itself and that was sad. But is war bad? Well at the end of the day: it is what it is. But most importantly: we are a family. The End” - robstein1313</p>

<p>“Is Star Fleet a military colonizing force? I think the real Star Fleet is the friends we made along the way.” - CouncilofGeeks</p>

<p>All of this was done to give character development to a character that I didn’t really care about and thought was just a little annoying at best, and now I kind of hate him. And this episode.</p>

<p><strong>Four and a Half Vulcans</strong> - SNW
3/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/04GBE4L.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Something about this title feels insulting</p>

<p>We’ve got more relationship troubles cause that’s all this show does now. La’an is ALREADY making shit awkward with Spock, and Pike’s girlfriend wants to get back to work, and needs Pike’s help making her old boss happy about it. But before we can do ANYTHING like that, we have to do some shenanigans.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/gMfQRpe.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>There’s a very flimsy reason that they need to do this, but they need to all become Vulcans through the reverse of that serum they gave Spock to make him Human for a bit. It doesn’t work on Pelia, who continues to be the best character in this season. The serum makes them all extremely annoying and theyre IMMEDIATELY working overtime to be weirdly racist towards Spock for being a half Vulcan. They go down to do the job they had to do, do it super fast, and then dip back up. But oops, the Vulcan serum doesn’t work and they can’t turn back.</p>

<p>Everyone is handling being a Vulcan Very Poorly. This is just badly written Vulcan things. Yes, logic can be used to justify bad things, like racism, or apparently in La’ans case BECOMING A SPACE CONQUERER? Yeah that’s a thing. Yes, you could justify all that with logic. If you’re a bad person who wants to come up with any reason to be bad you can do that. It’s very easy! But these are not bad people. These are good people who want to do good things. But they are not now, because of bad writing.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/SPXpIT9.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They decide to stay as Vulcans (though La’an is clearly actually a Romulan, which could be VERY bad), because it’s so much better for everyone. Obviously. I say this is grounds for IMMEDIATELY locking them up and mutinying, but even Spock is like “maybe we should not do that”, and he’s being shafted so hard. All the Vulcans do horrible things, like Uhura LTERALLY brainwashes Beto. Hmm. They need help, so Una seeks help from her ex, Doug.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/CZKI7VS.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This is Doug. He’s a Vulcan who is fond of Human cultures and when he and Una are nearby each other they want to make out with each other violently. It’s comedic in a way that does NOT fit. Doug agrees to help them connect with the Vulcan’s katras, which they, no joke, do off screen. Just, cut to black, come back in, “Anyways we solved it”. Are you shitting my dick????</p>

<p>Only one person is resisting being brought back, and that’s La’an. Spock talks to her inside her mind, and he straight up says “Your sadistic and untrusting and violent, that’s because you are related to Khan”. WE LITERALLY HAD AN EPISODE ABOUT THIS, ABOUT HOW BIO-ESSENTIALISM ISN’T REAL AND SHE CAME TO ACCEPT THAT PART OF HERSELF. BUT NOW NO, BIO ESSENTIALISM IS REAL. YOU’RE EVIL, LIKE ALL IN YOUR LINE.</p>

<p>They fight, then dance, and then she goes “okay yes change me back”. The rest of the episode is like 10 more minutes of everyone going “holy shit I’m so sorry for being awful” and then it ends. This episode kinda sucked. The writing was DRASTICALLY uneven. There were some fun moments and a lot of really bad ones.</p>

<p>At the end though you have Spock giving Doug a How To Be A Human lesson and I kinda like that.</p>

<p><strong>Terrarium</strong> - SNW
7/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/btQTDWc.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This is something I’ve wanted since Strange New Worlds first came out. We’re FINALLY getting it. An Ortegas central episode. Ortegas has always been around and good with snarking in the sidelines, but she’s never gotten her own centric episode. Everyone else has gotten like, 3 each. So why am I worried?</p>

<p>Because the writing has been pretty bad this season, AND they have this “Ortegas has PTSD” side plot. I can think of a MILLION ways they could fuck this up.</p>

<p>Ortegas is sent out in a shuttle to do a simple solo mission to release a subspace relay, when suddenly a wormhole pops up RIGHT on top of her and she’s sucked into it. Enterprise sees her disappear, with her last line being “I’VE GOT IT! I’VE GOT-“. And then boom, she’s gone. Damn, rest in peace, Ortegas.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/zFOXC4C.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>No, obviously not. She manages to release the buoy before crash landing. Her rations get burned up in the crash, I dunno why you’d put the rations next to the explodium. So she goes about preparing to survive on a hostile alien world.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/LoVVWiI.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Okay, props to the writers of this so far. If you asked me how Ortegas would handle being stranded on an alien planet, it’s EXACTLY this. She’d talk to herself a lot and be sassy. Honestly, they don’t even need writers. Point a camera at a good actor and let her adlib for 45 minutes, and you’ve got an Ortegas episode. Fantastic. She’s doin’ shit like building a condensor and going “Hello Mr. Condensor, please Condense” like, I love it?</p>

<p>Back on Enterprise, they gotta go meet Captain Decker of the Constellation soon so they don’t have time to stick around for a rescue. If you don’t remember, Decker is from the episode of TOS where they fight the Planet Eater. Or as I call it, The Windsock, and as I call him, The Windsock Guy. Uhura is DETERMINED to get Ortegas back, and fights for them to stay.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/dpfOrtm.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Ortegas finds a Gorn living on the moon she’s stranded on. At first it seems like they’re gonna fight, but the Gorn is actually… not very aggressive? It kills something and gives Ortegas some of it. It’s a disgusting bug, but hey, shockingly friendly Gorn. The Gorn is injured, though, and Ortegas obviously doesn’t trust it, so she basically robs the Gorn and tries to run away back to her shelter. She sees a light in the sky, aaaand the shuttle falls into a sinkhole. Whoops. Ortegas is then attacked by more bugs, but is SAVED by the Gorn! New Gorn Best Friend :o</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/QHOWVNj.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Ortegas can’t really communicate with the Gorn easily, but fashions a communicator that can give yes or nos, basically. The Gorn can actually understand her, because “you want to understand your enemy?” “Agree”. The Gorn and Ortegas spend time getting to know one another. It’s a girl Gorn, so it’s “a couple of girls having a slumber party”. Ortegas teaches her Chess, she teaches her some kind of game. They actually get along rather well. New Gorn GIRLFRIEND?!</p>

<p>The Gorn is too injured, and if it’s rescued, that’s a death sentence. The Gorn blow up their own ships if they’re too weak. Ortegas is like “Well, then come with us, and show my people that you’re as wonderful as you showed me!” The Gorn doesn’t seem very happy about that. All the while, Ortegas feels like she’s being watched, and there’s these weird lights in the sky. I think I know what’s going on.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/qaesgzY.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Ortegas and the Gorn work together, Ortegas convincing her to TRY and stay alive, and they have one wild plan. Light a GIANT explosion that’ll hopefully alert Enterprise they’re there and get them teleported out. Ortegas risks her life to light the flare, getting the attention of Enterprise… but also something else. And when Enterprise comes and immediately blasts the Gorn, killing it, Ortegas goes NUTS. Screaming out at whatever’s watching her. And it’s…</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/rdScTg6.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>I FUCKING CALLED IT. The Metron is like “We need more data to determine if the Gorn and the Humans can ever find peace.” AKA, Arena. The Metron says Ortegas isn’t ready to meet them, erases her memories, and then they’re sent back. And the Gorn? Still dead. Still very, very dead. Fucking god dammit. My Gorlnfriend &gt;:(</p>

<p>This was FANTASTIC until the bad feeling at the end. It’s just a shaggy dog story. And the Metron being there actually doesn’t add much, it prolly would have been better without it. Weirdly nostalgia bating for nothing to add to it. This WOULD have been a 9/10, maybe even higher, if they had stuck that landing. But right now it’s just…. kinda anger enducing.</p>

<p><strong>New Life and New Civilizations</strong> - SNW
3/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/4cgRq8Z.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We start with a party in Pike’s quarters to celebrate Patel leaving the Enterprise. Everyone looks fantastic. Spock is just wearing his normal outfit though, and he’s also hushing the buzz by talking about evil lizard bullshit at the party. Read the room, Spock.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/jwOVlP4.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>WHY IS ROGER KORBY ON FUCKING ZENDIKAR</p>

<p>WHY IS ZENDIKAR CANON TO THE STAR TREK UNIVERSE</p>

<p>Anyways Korby doing some kinda science thing on a place and it’s interrupted by… GAMBLE! Dun dun dun! His pattern is taken out of the buffer which is a bit weird, considering his pattern wasn’t put INTO it really, the pokeball was instead, but whatever. If you don’t remember, Gamble was possessed by a Vezda, some ancient energy being. They all plan to go rescue Korby and figure out wtf is going on and stop the Vezda. Patel is going too, cause her Gorn DNA is making her go. As if the death flags weren’t already raised. Everyone is getting in on this. Even <strong>J Kirk</strong>. Why? Because it’s the finale, we need all the characters here, and we have SO many of them. This is really where only 10 episodes per season is stretching this.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/NkSOsVC.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Anyways some of the people here worship the Vezda. There’s also something about destiny and M’Benga? It’s weird, it makes no sense. But the Vezda basically kidnaps M’Benga and uses him to transport to the prison where all the Vezda are, and then releases the other Vezda.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/8KnzsM8.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Patel now has Star Child eyes. Chapel finds out that her life signs are the same as the Beholder Statue that was locking the Vezda in. What the fuck is going on? This is nonsense. The pacing is off. There’s some shit about how the Vezda are inherent primal evil, which is stupid nonsense I won’t even dignify that with a response, but also becoming hybridized for some reason wakes up genetic memory where she’s now built to Fight Evil. THE GORN SAVED THE GALAXY AGAINST AN ANCIENT EVIL? Whatever. She’s becoming Captain Marvel.</p>

<p>This is dumb beyond words.</p>

<p>“We have to get power to Patel and Pike” oh you know, Power. Just gotta Beam Them Power. And a ship can generate exactly half of that and shoot it in a phaser blast. Luckily Kirk is here. Remember btw Kirk is NOT the Captain of the Farragut. Why is he their contact on the Farragut? Talk to the fucking captain about this. Anyways they’ll both have to shoot a laser at the ship perfectly connected. And they do this via a mind link.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/5zTUMcZ.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Spirk hinting is going to be the best thing about this episode.</p>

<p>Anyways they mind meld and now are mind connected and talking, away from each other, in two seperate ships. This is not how this works. This is not, and has never been, how mind melds work. We are knee deep in the writers strike right now fellas. Anyways Pike and Patel make their way in to Vezda Jail, and she’s about to have a fucking wizard duel when suddenly it’s interrupted by what seems to be a jump cut where she and Pike are happily married.</p>

<p>It’s obviously some kind of lotus eater machine.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/jj7hjSS.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>It’s nice to see them age gracefully and live a nice happy comfy life at least. Pike doesn’t get mutilated, life goes on. He’s very confused but they don’t go “oh we’re in a lotus eater machine”, it takes a long time for them to figure anything out. There’s also a lot of stuff about knocking at the door, I dunno. It’s not quite Inner Light, I’ll say that. She says some shit about how she needed this so that she could remember him, and then</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/4w7XX72.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We’re back to your previously scheduled Wizard Duel. Patel uses Magic to become a new statue, and that’s it.</p>

<p>We get some attempts at closure. Kirk and Spock literally go “We will always be friends”. Also remember the hot three armed bartender from episode 2 of this season? Not there. WTF. Why even have the promise of her??</p>

<p>We get a voice over by Pike about “No one we’ve truly loved is ever gone” and it’s… okay I guess. He’s a bit depressed but he’s doing his best.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>This season was bad!!</p>

<p>Almost the entirety of it was not good to bad! Like, wow! I’m astounded!!! Considering the high highs of season 1 and 2, it’s wiiiild. It’d be like going from TNG season 5 to TNG Season 1. Like, it’s not the worst, and there are highlights, but bluh.</p>

<p>One of my biggest problems is that Pike was kinda pushed into the background for a lot of it. But that’s not even close to the biggest issue. I dunno. Let’s hope for better???</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="Strange New Worlds" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 189</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/10/08/OOCY189.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 189" /><published>2025-10-08T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-10-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/10/08/OOCY189</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/10/08/OOCY189.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/OaYRaeW.png" alt="'" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p>IT’S BEEN A LOOOOONG ROOOOOAAAD</p>

<p><strong>Fusion</strong> - ENT
4/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/sqridOn.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Enterprise is exploringa far nebula when they’re contacted by a Vulcan ship. The captain is all smiles, which is IMMEDIATELY weird. They ask for some assistance, explain they’re civilians, and when the captain meets for dinner, he happily eats meat and is all smiles. The Captain is nice, but his 2nd in command is a smarmy asshole. They explain they’re V’tosh ka’tur, Vulcans without Logic. That name MIGHT be familiar… that’s Sybok. These guys are Pre-Syboks. T’Pol is not amused.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/klbapEf.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This guy has the most punchable face in space, and every second he’s on screen I’m afraid he’s about to sexually assault someone and then say it’s “just a joke bro”. He tries to chat up T’Pol and I’m expecting him to force a mind meld with her by the end of the episode. He explains that they’re not REJECTING Surak’s teachings, quite the opposite. It’s more that they’re a heresy that believes the teachings are misinterpreted, and he wanted Vulcans to “MASTER” their emotions. Whatever that means.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/M2GxlhM.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We basically have two stories here. T’Pol with the smarmy guy, Tolaris, and this guy, Tor, the engineer. He’s a friendly guy who likes making pals on the ship. Tor’s dad asks Archer to try and convince Tor to contact him, since he’s dying, and Tor refuses to talk to him. Emotional manipulation time?</p>

<p>SPEAKING OF EMOTIONAL MANIPULATION, HEY, I CALLED IT. T’Pol has a sex dream about Tolaris. Creeps Invading Psychics With Sex Dreams is not a new phenomena in Star Trek, but I hate it every time it happens.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/5qqhnXX.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This dude’s body language is rancid, just HANGING over her with that fucking smirk. I dunno why she’s humoring him.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/vmqLPtL.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Hey look, I called it. I hate being psychic.</p>

<p>Archer finds out what happens, basically tricks Tolaris into throwing him across the fucking room, and kicks him out of the ship. Good, fuck that guy. Trip helps Tor talk to his dad, and it goes better than expected. So while sometimes the emotional vulcan experiment doesn’t work, it can. Tor seems like a good guy.</p>

<p><strong>Rogue Planet</strong> - ENT
8/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/wZd1v9l.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>While flying through space, Enterprise finds a rogue planet. Wow, title drop. This is a real phoenomenon where planets are just… floating in space. It’s not COMMON but it’s a thing. They find a ship on it, but it ignores their hails.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/2VVOqZu.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The planet is actually habitable, due to thermal vents, which is kinda nuts. The crew quickly finds the aliens here, the Eska, who are hunters hunting some dangerous game that lives on this planet. Reed offers to join them for a hunt, but the others are kinda disturbed by the idea of hunting. As Archer says, hunting went out of favor on Earth a century ago, but they do still appreciate the hunters’ hospitality.</p>

<p>That night, Archer senses something out in the forest, and goes after it. A bit wild to do that after hearing the hunters explain all the dangerous animals that lurk in the dark. He finds a young human woman with long blond hair, wearing a night gown. She calls Archer by name, and then disappears into the foliage. Interesting :o</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/EKdA3n3.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The others are like “Sir, there’s no Humans on this planet but us, don’t be nuts, you’re hallucinating”. Everyone thinks he’s being a fool, which is really funny and shows this really IS Early Trek, since after being in space for 200 years, Starfleet goes “You saw something weird? Got it, time to do all the tests we can”, while here they’re like “Silly Captain, weird things don’t happen in Trek”.</p>

<p>She appears again and is like “Hey, I’m contacting you SPECIFICALLY because I need help. And I’m taking this form because you’d be reticent to it”. This is pretty obvious, I think, where this story is going. But that doesn’t make it BAD. It looks like its a Devil in the Dark situation, a non-humanoid is being hurt and wants to reach out for help. Also this girl is played by the super sexy Trill from Insurrection. Yay!</p>

<p>After some more shenanigans, Archer gets to talk to her again, and she explains that the Eska are hunting THEM. The Eska, for what its worth, seems to not realize there’s anything sapient on the planet. Archer finds out more by talking to the hunters, learning about beings called the Wraiths, animals that are able to psychically read minds. Ah, I see.</p>

<p>The Eska sense them by reading a pheremone they give off when scared. Phlox develops something to help mask it, and all’s well. The Eska are pissed and suspicious, but can’t prove anything.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ICxl0v3.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>SLUG MOMMY!</p>

<p>Pretty good episode for Enterprise, honestly.</p>

<p><strong>Acquisition</strong> - ENT
9/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/XlElzh9.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>THE FERENGI ARE HERE! We know Starfleet had SOME interractions with the Ferengi before TNG, none good, but it’s fascinating to see them. They do something to gas Enterprise and then make their way in to rob the place, not without weirdly sexually harassing T’Pol. Ohhh, Ferengi. Never change (?)</p>

<p>One of these Ferengi is played by the same actor as Neelix. It’s nice to see him! Is this the first time a main actor character has come back in a cameo role? I can’t remember any others happening. I know a few in reverse.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/UQWjlr0.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Everyone is knocked out… except for one. Of COURSE it’s Trip. OF FUCKING COURSE IT’S TRIP. I swear to God, he gets more love than Archer does. He was stuck in decon, so he gets spared. Now he’s gotta Die Hard around the ship. All the while the Ferengi are going about their business, taking the things they personally like. One has big colorful socks and are stealing shoes. Another is gathering all the women. Oooof course. I miss DS9, when their weird sexism was mocked more openly.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/KzzlHiQ.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They wake Archer up, and he tries to play them pretty well after a little bit. Tries haggling, talks up the weakest one, kinda befriends him. He doesn’t have the lobes. He sees Trip is awake, and sneaks a message to him about how to wake up the others like he got wake up. We get T’Pol up, but none of the others for some reason.</p>

<p>T’Pol plays the other three Ferengi against each other, doing things with some remote control scanners that makes them stop trusting each other. Very smart.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/1SfLtjG.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>T’Pol AND Archer are actually both very good at this. I guess Trip’s job is to run around half naked. Though honestly when he’s put on the line, he does a VERY good job faking a fight with Archer. “THEY’RE GONNA TAKE MY WIFE, YOU GREEDY SON OF A BITCH”, then promises to show them where the Gold Vault is.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/MTgbFf8.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They’re all so shockingly good at this. T’Pol seduces the weaker one and then knocks him the fuck out. This episode is filled with a lot of great character moments, holy hell. Trip lures them into a trap and T’Pol shoots them, knocking them out. They then force them to put EVERYTHING back.</p>

<p>Archer lets Krem, the weaker one, take control of his ship while the others are tied up, and they fly off, while Archer puts the Ferengi in the database as dangerous. Anyways this is absolutely fantastic, the best episode of Enterprise so far prolly. Grading on the Enterprise scale, it’s like a 10/10. Grading on the NORMAL scale, prolly a 9 lol</p>

<p><strong>Oasis</strong> - ENT

<p>The Enterprise meets a trader who tells them of a planet not far from here that has a crashed ship that he couldn’t scrap for parts, because “the crew objected”, even though nothing is alive there. Ooh, scary, interesting~</p>

<p>They go down to explore the ship, even though there’s a MILLION red flags. It’s weird for them to like, try to scavenge a ship. The only time I can think of that ever happening was Terok Nor, and that was a special case.</p>

<p>Obviously no, they are not alone. There ARE people living there. These are people on a supply vessel that was shot down by raiders. They’ve been hiding here now for three years, unable to get the ship flying. And yes, that IS Odo! I know I literally JUST last episode went “I can’t remember a main actor coming back for a cameo” and here he is. Hi Rene, it’s so good to see you. Archer agrees to try and help them get their ship flying again.</p>

<p>These aliens, the Kantare, are not UNFRIENDLY, but are a little standoffish. And they don’t want the younger Kantare to really interract with the crew. There’s a girl called Liana who’s a little standoffish too at first, but is friendly to Trip after he tries to open up with her. T’Pol is like “of COURSE you’re trying to sleep with her too”. Trip claims he’s not. Oh please.</p>

<p>Some things the Kantare are saying aren’t really making sense. Scans show their ship has been there for a VERY long time. Over 20 years. Meanwhile, they also find a corpse of one of the Kantare that they saw on the ship, alive, an hour ago. When Trip confronts Liana about this, she’s like “OKAY I GOTTA GO BYYYEEE” and dips. Sussy.</p>

<p>The Kantare capture Trip and T’Pol and force them to fix the ship. Trip goes “You’ve got a LOT to learn about making friends” and Odo says “I’ve made all the friends I need”, which I think gives the game away.</p>

<p>Yeah, so only Odo and his daughter survived the original crash. Odo blames himself for killing the rest of the crew and made holograms of them to try and deal with the trauma and guilt. He left his station during the crash to save his daughter, which is why he blames himself. Poor guy. After learning exactly what happened, they agree to help fix the holographic systems, if that’s what they REALLY want. But they need to be sure of that.</p>

<p>They convince Odo to fix the ship and head back home. He’s happy there, but his daughter isn’t. Trip and Liana kiss, and that was about it. This was okay, but it feels like a retread of previous Trek ideas</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="Enterprise" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 188</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/10/04/OOCY188.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 188" /><published>2025-10-04T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-10-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/10/04/OOCY188</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/10/04/OOCY188.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/rcngdeP.png" alt="'" class="center-block" /></p>
