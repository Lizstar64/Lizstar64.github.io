<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Waltz</strong> - DS9
10/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/NsVrj1L.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We start with Benjamin walking into Dukat’s jail cell. He’s being transported to a starbase, for a warcrime case. “You think I did warcrimes?” Uh, yes. I do. We all do. Because you did. Anyways he’s doing better! Psychiatric therapy is working, and he’s no longer… AS unstable. Just… kind of unstable. He accepts Ziyal’s death, and is trying to look forward, for his sake and for her’s. I like how this show keeps teasing and hinting that Dukat can and COULD be a good person… but he keeps making the worst decisions you possibly could.</p>

<p>Anyways this ship they’re on is attacked and blown up. There are known survivors, because they know that some shuttles and escape pods made it out, but… no one knows if Sisko is alive. I mean, we do. We see him and Dukat. JUST him and Dukat. Sisko is severely injured, shattered arm, sick, unhealthy. Dukat EASILY could have left Sisko, OR killed him. But he didn’t. He probably views Sisko as a friend, in that twisted Dukat way, and as a worthy adversary, this isn’t “fair”. So he’s taking care of Sisko, and doing what he can. He also has a general distress call out, neither Dominion nor Federation, “to make it fair”.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/2IXW5Lg.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>But also Dukat is clearly NOT doing as well as he says or seems. He’s seeing Weyoun, who’s mocking him and telling him to do murders. And Sisko isn’t making it easier, by basically insulting Dukat. I mean, y’know, he’s just being himself, but… there’s a huge fear and anxiety about whether Dukat will snap and kill Sisko, and Sisko isn’t really aware of it… At least, until Sisko finds out that Dukat never actually set up the distress call and was lying about it. So now he has to sneak around about it too, as Dukat is off discussing things with imaginary Damar. And keep in mind, again, he is very injured. And Dukat is eratic, and pops in and out all the time.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/bfRjHYw.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>After Sisko realizes that Dukat is yelling at an imaginary Kira, he is far more willing to play the game, but Dukat is too far gone, and when he finds out that Sisko had fixed the distress signal, he lashes out, and hits Sisko with a pipe.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ztFoZoS.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Now there’s no pretenses. Everything is out, and it’s a full on argument, a literal debate. Dukat wants, NEEDS Sisko to realize and tell Dukat that all of the deaths of Bajorans wasn’t his fault. So now it’s a nearly dying Sisko and a WILDLY unstable Dukat, explaining why he had to do fascism. He HAD to! HE WAS FORCED TO! HIS HAND WAS FORCED!!</p>

<p>This episode is fucking amazing. It’s also worth mentioning that this episode’s title with the developoment crew was “Dukat’s Head”. DUKAT’S BRAIN. I FUCKING LOVE IT. This episode, and this scene, has a LOT to say about colonialism, and fascism, and it’s… EXTREMELY heavy and loaded, and very, very good. When I talk about why I love Dukat and he’s a great villain, he’s acted so well, he’s FUCKING EVIL and VERY good to watch. It ends with him shouting about how he should have KILLED THEM ALL! Sisko hits him over the head, and escapes to the shuttle craft, but is caught again by Dukat.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/VEtSQCN.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Gul Dukat leaves in the shuttle, after declaring that “Bajor is dead”. Damn. This is going to be VERY important in the future. And Sisko declares, as he is rescued (they see Dukat leaving and find out Sisko was there), that it’s Dukat or him. He now knows what evil is. And he fears no evil. He will NOT let him destroy Bajor.</p>

<p>This episode is very very good, and is interesting a literal response to the fact that Trek fans liked Dukat. And I like Dukat, but fans liked Dukat in a different way. Like, they were defending his actions on forums. And the writers were like “oh no. Well, we did it. We made a good villain, but he might have gone too far”. And some people claim they went too far in the OTHER direction to fight that, and Dukat’s descent into an insane omnicidal maniac is off the wall, but uh, no. It fits. I am excited to see how it progresses from here, though.</p>

<p><strong>Who Mourns for Morn</strong> - DS9
8.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/2gWzZ6g.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Odo comes in and yells at Morn about not doing a thing he was supposed to do, but Morn won’t even respond, which is wild, because Morn is such a little chatterbox. But no, it’s not actually Morn. Morn’s been on a business trip for two weeks, so Quark set up a hologram of Morn sitting in his chair, because Morn is “the mascot”, and when he’s not there, people wonder where he is, ask about him, are worried about him.</p>

<p>This episode, and Morn, is all a giant joke. He’s a background alien who was given a name. That’s it. And he was put in his spot every episode, a popular location for shootings, so he’s been seen a lot. And as he was seen a lot, people ended up liking him. And since they liked him, he was given some background information, and all of that information was meta jokes at the concept of him. He talks a lot (he never speaks a single time), he’s a big ugly alien but he is constantly SWIMMING in pussy. He seems to somehow be rich, even though he literally never leaves the bar. And this episode is just a giant addition to the joke, a large conclusion to the punchline.</p>

<p>Turns out Morn is dead.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/wsGbm3R.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Everyone on the station shows up for the funeral proceedings. Quark makes a big talk about Morn’s seat, and sits a random person in the seat… who is Morn’s actor, out of makeup. This episode is filled with jokes like that. It’s a deepcut episode for huge nerds. I am a HUGE fucking nerd. We learn a lot of small fun things about Morn. Dax had a crush on Morn, but was turned down. IMAGINE. DAX, THE HOTTEST WOMAN IN SPACE, NOT BEING ENOUGH FOR MORN. Well Morn WAS a stunning bachelor.</p>

<p>Anyways, Morn left his entire estate to Quark. All the rotten beets he had in storage. His room, which just has a mud bath. But INSIDE the mud bath is Morn’s wife, who is here to explain that Morn had a shit ton of money hidden away somewhere, and she wants some of it. She comes on VERY strong.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/7fcv1uL.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We also start finding MORE people who are very interested in Morn’s assets. Two sleezy alien brothers who are VERY friendly and VERY threatening. And then an officer of some jurisdiction, who claims Morn was a prince of his planet, and all the money was the money he got as a gift from his parents. All of them are harassing poor Quark, who’s trying to get all of the money issues squared away at the same time.</p>

<p>Eventually it all comes to a head, ALL of it a lie. They were actually all bank robbers. Years ago the four of them, and Morn, robbed a bank. Morn betrayed them all and ran with the money. Now, years later, the statute of limitations was up, and they wanted their damn money. But they still need Quark to actually get the money from the bank delivery. But once he gets it open and shows off the latinum, they all turn on each other and start firing. Quark flees into the case of Latinum, and then Odo comes and bails him out. They’re all going to jail, and the latinum is ALL Quark’s, all 1000 bricks of it! He’s RICH! Oh, wait, no, it’s all just USELESS GOLD, someone sucked all the latinum out of them.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/QhgIu2m.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>It also turns out that Morn is still alive! He faked is own death, and threw poor Quark under the bus, hoping he’d get the robbers taken care of. And well, he did. But Quark is PISSED. Morn is going to explain himself, but Quark doesn’t even want to HEAR him right now. But when Morn vomits up some liquid latinum, which he’s kept hidden in his second stomach for six years, Quark is okay with it. It’s practically 100 bricks worth.</p>

<p>This episode is goofy and fun. It’s a little slow around the middle, which is why it’s not an all timer, but it’s FILLED to the brim with fun jokes.</p>

<p><strong>Far Beyond the Stars</strong> - DS9
11/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/iFVCRjQ.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This is one of the big ones. Maybe the biggest one. This is possibly the most acclaimed Star Trek episode of all time. It’s certainly top 5. I’ve never seen it. Let’s go.</p>

<p>Sisko is overworked and stressed. Friends are dying in this dumbass war, and he feels like the entire alpha quadrant’s future is on his back. And he’s also going nuts. He’s starting to see visions, people walking around DS9 clearly out of place. After he has some kind of attack, Bashir explains he seems to be havign teh same effect as when he was having visions from the prophets last season. He’s looking into it, but then.. Sisko is in the dream.</p>

<p>Sisko is now Benny Russell, a struggling sci-fi writer in the 1950s. He’s a black man in the big city, and is struggling. His coworkers all like to tolerate him, but of course he’s harassed the cops. But the thing is, every other actor is an actor from DS9. Kira, O’Brien, and Quark are all co-writers of his. Odo’s his boss. Martok is the artist who writes things to help give them ideas. Dax is the secretary. Nog is the news boy. Worf is a baseball player after Benny’s girlfriend, who wants him to give up on being a writer and join her at the cafe. Dukat and Weyoun are cops who assault him for no reason. And Sisko’s father is a preacher on the street, talking to Benny directly. Telling him to write the story. Write the story.</p>

<p>What’s the story? Benny writes a story called Deep Space 9. It’s a bright future, a happy future. …It’s a future with a black captain. Odo, the boss, refuses to publish it. I mean, he’s SYMPATHETIC to the black cause, sure, but come on, Benny. He can’t publish this! It could cause race riots! RACE RIOTS! IMAGINE IT! What’s next, a black woman as the communication officer?!?! Quark’s actor is the best here, he’s the one who keeps sticking up for Benny, he’s a loud Jewish guy. Him and Kira are most vocal about it beign good, cause y’know, they’re minorities too. Others are sympathetic, enough, y’know. They don’t See Race :) You know how it is.</p>

<p>We get scenes from this man’s life. Him fighting for his story. Him trying, and failing, at trying to survive in a world that hates him. It’s very, very heavy, and EXTREMELY good and powerful. We see him win his story, but then the owner of the paper cancels the entire paper and fires him for even TRYING to <strong>write about a black character</strong>. I mean, come one, he was kind enough to even allow this colored man to work here, and he gets all UPPITY. This is after Benny is beaten near to death by cops for daring to cry about his friend getting shot and killed.</p>

<p>And then we get maybe the best scene.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ijrnOVX.png" alt="trek" />
<img src="https://imgur.com/vCTTDSl.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>I know people who mock this scene, and say that Avery Brooks is a bad actor. They need to shut the fuck up.</p>

<p>Benny is carried off after his nervous breakdown, and then Sisko wakes back up… he has a lot to think about. His vision from the Prophets is over, and now, where can he go from here? What if, instead… he IS just the figment of a man’s imagination? It says the quiet part out loud, it was always a theme and concept, a what if, but it puts it directly out there.</p>

<p>This episode is obviously one of the best. I don’t even have much to say about it. It stands on its own. It’s not an episode neccesarily for me, but I love it regardless.</p>

<p>I’m sure it was all the actor’s favorite episode too, because they didn’t need to sit in the makeup chair for hours.</p>

<p><strong>One Little Ship</strong> - DS9
8/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/q69S1I1.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Hey, we’re doing something NOT related to the Dominion for once! We’re doing some science! They’re testing an anomaly that SHOULD make the ship that goes into it tiny and smol. They tether onto it, holding it so it doesn’t fly into the anomaly. Dax, Bashir, and O’Brien are tiny and smol in the shuttle, and studying it. Unfortunately, things get bad. Yeah, I lied, the Dominion show up, beat the shit out of the Defiant, which is trying to keep the shuttle from falling into the anomaly so it can’t fight back, aaaand boom. The shuttle falls into the anomaly. They’re dead.</p>

<p>No, obviously not. They’re just tiny. They DID escape the anomaly, but they’re now tiny.</p>

<p>Anyways, the Jem’Hadar control the Defiant now. Something is new with the Jem’Hadar. They’re breeding a new race of Jem’Hadar, Alpha Jem’Hadar, who are “specifically bred for psychological profiles and combat readiness in this sector”. Whatever that means. But that ALSO means that they invented racism, because the Gammas and Alphas are kind of at each other’s throats. The Second, an Elder, is angry that the First, an Alpha, is the First now. And also not immediately killing Sisko. I dunno why he wnats to kill Sisko so damn bad, but they need Sisko to get the Warp Drive back online. So they get Sisko, Kira, Worf, and Nog to work on the Engine. The Second does not trust Sisko and his men to ACTUALLY work on the Warp Core…. and he’s right, they’re trying to get control of the ship from Engineering and hoping no one notices.</p>

<p>Someone does notice… The shuttle. They snuck in through the exhaust. I guess its just open to space, sure, and get into Engineering. So they’re going to basically act as the little angels trying to save the crew. They go to the bridge and sneak around, using clever tactics, like booping the door to distract the Jem Hadar like it’s fucking Skyrim.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/RdAmPqV.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They beam into a computer to change the circuits in there. This must have been very fun to shoot.</p>

<p>The shuttle manages to reroute control, and then goes in guns blazing, blasting Jem’Hadar with fucking photon torpedos. The ensuing chaos allows them to regain control. The episode ends with some fun jokes about being smol.</p>

<p>This one was a little goofy and fun. Weirdly, the Alpha and Gamma Jem’Hadar stuff will never come back.</p>

<p><strong>Honor Among Thieves</strong> - DS9
8/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/laWK7Z0.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>O’Brien is undercover in a seedy bar in the armpit of the universe. Why is it O’BRIEN? Dunno. Just had to be. O’Brien is good at what he does, I guess. He’s not an INTELLIGENCE SPY, and he’s also kind of famous, but it’s fine. Anyways, he’s under cover, watching some Orion Syndicate peoples. He gets an in with them when he spikes one of their little brain connector thingies, and then saves them. Boom, he’s got an in.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on DS9, everything is falling apart. Y’know, cause O’Brien is gone. Yeah, as you’d expect.</p>

<p>O’Brien is playing the quiet, kinda awkward type. He’s almost playing Smiley. He gets in with Bilby, one of the small bigwigs in the Orion Syndicate. He’s an old, relatively pleasant guy. He’s kinda generous, has a sense of humor. Totally willing to work with O’Brien, who’s a genius who can fix anything, cause hey, he needs some stuff fixed. Who doesn’t.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/PdAAJOp.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The episode is as follows. O’Brien hangs out with literal gangsters, who are friendly, and then we see them blast a guy in the stomach for selling them shitty merchendise. And then he goes to a smoky alley and meets with his handler, giving him information.</p>

<p>It all takes a biiiit of a turn when Bilby covers for O’Brien. This means that if O’Brien is a rat (which he is), Bilby is dead. This IMMEDIATELY starts weighing on O’Brien. Bilby’s not a bad guy. Sure he’s doing bad, illegal things, but like, he doesn’t seem to really want to be in this life. He just can’t get out. He’s a sad man living alone in his apartment with his cat. He can’t see his wife and kids, cause of his work with the Syndicate, and if things go wrong, they’re dead, and it’s his fault. It’s a rough life.</p>

<p>O’Brien finds out a lot. He finds who the Orion Syndicate man’s on the inside is. He finds out the Dominion is working with the Syndicate. He finds out that the Syndicate is going to assassinate a Klingon, to cause instability. And when he finds that out, his handler takes him out. He’s in too deep, getting too sympathetic… so he decks his handler, and goes to warn Bilby.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/rjw0nwo.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>But there’s nothing he can do. Bilby is in too deep. If he tells the Orion Syndicate its a trap, he’ll still be killed for sticking up for O’Brien. If he runs, his family will be killed. He could kill O’Brien, but he just… can’t bring himself to. So he asks O’Brien to look after his cat, and goes to die. O’Brien is shattered, but life goes on. He killed a man, but life goes on.</p>

<p>I really liked this episode, it was tense. The rest of the watch party didn’t, I was alone here. It does feel weird, a bit out of place. It’s not very Trekky. And parts of O’Brien feel out of character. But I still liked it, what can I say.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="DS9" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 46</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/11/09/OOCY46.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 46" /><published>2024-11-09T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-11-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/11/09/OOCY46</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/11/09/OOCY46.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/UiNuWU0.png" alt="&quot;Kisses aren't something you can do in a half-hearted way!

<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p><strong>Sacrifice of Angels</strong> - DS9
8/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/gQkHIj5.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Tensions are high. In eight hours those mines are going down, and while Sisko is surviving, it’s just barely. So the rebels on DS9 need to do something, and fast. What’s their plan? A bomb. Too bad Damar arrests all of them on suspicions of them being rebels, which I mean, they are. So now it’s all on the last member of the resistance who ISN’T detained. And that’s Quark.</p>

<p>It’s literally all on Quark. We’re fucked.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/10EwmIN.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Dukat is cocky. He knows what he’s doing, and he knows he’s going to win. What… IS he doing, anyway? He and Damar are like “once this war is done we’ll break off from the Dominion~” Uh fucking how? How do you EVER expect that of happening??? Cardassia’s best opportunity was siding with the Federation, and they betrayed them instead. Anyways Dukat is an absolute trashfire of a person, and there’s a good scene with him and Weyoun showing the differences between him/Cardassia and the rest of the Dominion. Weyoun is like “Welp, we’ll have to genocide everyone on Earth once we conquer the Federation, because they can’t be controlled” and Dukat is like “why would we do that??? What’s the point of fascism if people can’t see you do it? The point is the GLOATING and powering OVER people!”</p>

<p>Odo is still bimbo-pilled by the female Changeling, but she just lets it slip that Kira is being executed because they’ll trump up charges even though they can’t find anything. Welp. Good job losing the easily won war with ONE thing cause you’rE SO sure of your bimbofication process.</p>

<p>Quark saves the day, with the help of Dukat’s daughter. In the process, Quark kills some guards, almost certainly the first person he’s EVER killed.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/uYjqb4K.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Odo breaks free of Bimbofication. “The link is paradise, but I’m not ready for paradise”. He and his guards blast away the people chasing Kira and the others, and they’re on their way to sabatoge the station. In the end though, they’re just SECONDS too late. The mines are taken down. Sisko goes into the wormhole, to meet the thousands of Dominion ships. Because of Kira, they can’t blow him up as his ship goes in.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/TEQYPKT.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The Sisko argues with the aliens, who are like “You are about to kill yourself trying to fight these forces.” and Sisko is like “I am :)” so they just…. hold the Dominion ships. They just Get Rid Of Them. It’s basically a deus ex machina. The Dominion is strong, but the Wormhole Aliens are BASICALLY gods. As compared to the Changelings, who just ACT like they’re gods.</p>

<p>Welp, the Dominion are fucked. They immediately schedule a retreat, cause the Klingons are bolstering the Federation. Gul Dukat is SHAKEN, and wanders the halls looking for Ziyal. When she tells him “I’m not leaving, also I helped the resistance”, he’s broken even more, and THEN Damar fucking shoots her, cause she’s a traitor. Damar you FUCKING IDIOT. This COMPLETELY SHATTERS Dukat, who straight up goes insane. He can’t comprehend that Ziyal is dead and he lost and he’s also part of the reason. He just rambles about forgiving her, and forgiving Sisko.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/rLkIkp6.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>It was a hard fought battle, but we did it. ALMOST a phyrric victory. So much of the fleet was lost. But we have the key to the Alpha Quadrant. There are cheers, and cries, and hugs. We did it.</p>

<p><strong>You are Cordially Invited</strong> - DS9
4/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/zQFRAOm.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Things are going well on DS9 now that it’s back under the Federation. Alexander is about to be transfered away though, so Worf and Dax’s wedding is pushed up to happen on DS9, so he can be there for it. How sweet. This episode then splits into two things. 1) Worf, Martok, Sisko, Alexander, O’Brien, and Bashir are doing a goofy Klingon-ass bachelor party. And 2) Dax is being judged by Martok’s wife to see if she is worthy to enter the house. She’s a xenophobic rich bitch asshole, and Martok is FUCKING TERRIFIED of her, which is very funny.</p>

<p>This episode also has one of my absolute favorite quotes in the entire show. “You’ve gained weight. And your hair is growing grey.” “My… deterioration is proceeding apace.”</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/BbNQLOF.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>God Dax is hot. Worf doesn’t deserve her. Worf is actually pretty good here, I kind of hate DS9 Worf, but this is feeling more TNG-ish. Like he’s like “Y’all are being xenophobic, that is stupid.” Dax is EXTREMELY defiant of this woman. It’s hot as fuck. It eventually ends with her calling the entire wedding off, which she has the power to do cause Klingon tradition is dumb. Worf tells her to beg, and she’s like “what? No, she’s a fucking xenophobic asshole, I won’t do that”, so WORF calls off the god damn wedding too, like “she was right about you”</p>

<p>NO. NO YOU IDIOT. AND THEN WHEN THEY CONVINCE WORF, AND SHE’S STILL MAD, THERE’S SOME DUMB SHIT WHERE ONCE SISKO TALKS TO HER, DAX IS LIKE “guess I gotta grow you”. NO. NO, HE IS NOT GOOD FOR YOU, AND WANTS YOU TO PUT UP WITH PEOPLE TREATING YOU LIKE SHIT. They do the whole “groveling to enter the house” thing off screen, I guess the mother in law just allows it now. This episode has some fun moments but in the end, I do not like Worf x Dax because I can’t stand DS9 Worf, and this is a good example of why.</p>

<p>At least it has this moment, one of my favorites.</p>

<p><strong>Resurrection</strong> - DS9
6.5/10</p>

<p>&lt;img src=”https://imgur.com/8cYbe65.png” alt=”trek”</p>

<p>Dax and Kira are having a conversation about how Kira needs to get laid basically, she hasn’t dated anyone in months. She’s fine with it, but Dax is shovy. Dax if you want her to date someone that bad, divorce Worf and date her. Please. Please do that. For the love of God, please. Unfortunately no. Instead, we get someone beaming into Ops. It’s MIRROR UNIVERSE VEDEK BAREIL! You remember him? He was the failed pope boy who died because his brain was turned into a cyborg or some shit. I never cared about him much.</p>

<p>This Bariel starts his existence in our story by holding Kira hostage with a broken gun, and begging to be allowed to stay in the prime universe, because the mirror universe is fucking garbage and who’d wanna live there? He seems like he’s trying to just… become a part of it, now, once he realizes how much better it is. He goes to church, though feels weird that his counterpart here was nearly pope and well respected, cause he’s a thief who is NOT respected. He’s basically a han solo-esque thief. Very different from our Bareil.</p>

<p>&lt;img src=”https://imgur.com/bHuGjXi.png” alt=”trek”</p>

<p>Obviously the two of them start getting into it. Kira says it’s not cause he looks like Bareil. He’s nothing LIKE him. But it’s cause he’s who he is. I dunno if I believe that lol. Bareil goes and has an Orb Experience, which is what it’s called, and we’ve been making fun of that phrase a LOT. He has his Orb Experience and it seems to be bothering him, but you’re Not Allowed To Talk About Your Orb Experience.</p>

<p>&lt;img src=”https://imgur.com/uHAHmTj.png” alt=”trek”</p>

<p>Anyways, hot sexy bisexual Kira is here. Turns out it’s all a ruse. He’s here to steal the Orb. He seems conflicted though. Seems his Orb Experience, and making out with the Major, and ALSO everyone thinking he’s Vedek Bareil is getting to him. It’s funny how Kira catches on to this. It’s not cause he slips up, or anything. It’s cause QUARK sees him for what he is, and flat out warns Kira. “He’s gonna rob the orb”. Quark sees RIGHT through him.</p>

<p>&lt;img src=”https://imgur.com/EdkxsC4.png” alt=”trek”</p>

<p>Once again, Quark saving the day. There’s a standoff with Bareil, Kira, and Kira, and Bareil shoots Kira and then wishes Kira well. He saw them being happy and in love in the orb, but he knew, he’d fuck it up some day. Might as well fuck it up now. And then it ends. This episode was fine.</p>

<p><strong>Statistical Probabilities</strong> - DS9
2/10</p>

<p>&lt;img src=”https://imgur.com/8cYbe65.png” alt=”trek”</p>

<p>So, people who have been genetically enhanced in the Federation, against their will specifically, are sent to an institute. What that implies isn’t explained yet, we just know that at the start of this. There are four genetically enhanced individuals, and treatments by the therapists and psychologists there aren’t working. Why they’d NEED them again, isn’t explained. These people are supposed to be genetically enhanced, instead they’re introduced and shown as if they have mental disorders. You’ve got the one who won’t talk, the anxious wreck, the overly sexual nympho, and the manic violent one. They’re trying something new to treat them and make them “valued members of society”, by having Bashir work with them. Bashir, also being genetically enhanced, can maybe find common ground. Bashir explains later that the REASON they’re all like this is because the enhancement failed, in a way, and caused unintended side effects.</p>

<p>So I see what they’re TRYING to do. Y’know, saying things using this world to say things about OUR world. In this case, they’re using the genetically enhanced to talk about how we, as a society, treat people with mental disorders. First, I want to state I am not qualified to talk about this. I’m neuroatypical, myself, but like, I NEVER feel comfortable talking about something so broad. But this makes me VERY uncomfortable. The violence is uncomfy. And also there’s a thing here like, ascribing almost supernatural abilities to being neuroatypical. Like, it’s nothing built of malice. It’s built from liberal ignorance.</p>

<p>&lt;img src=”https://imgur.com/pKCZTlL.png” alt=”trek”</p>

<p>ANYWAYS there’s plot. Damar is the new leader. He’s also Gul Damar, even though Guls are just planetary governors and not dictators, but Dukat kept Gul to appear humble so I guess Damar does too. The Dominion is looking for peace treaties, and are willing to give over a lot of land for that reason. The Neurosis Squad looks over the proceedings using a computer, scanning them, and use their Big Meaty Superbrains to determine what the dominion REALLY wants. They can also just tell what O’Brien is thinking by looking at him. They’re trying to go with a “they’re very analytical” but instead they’re just, psychic. And they can apparently use these powers to be able to read the future. Okay, whatever.</p>

<p>One thing I kinda like about this is that Bashir is VERY unhappy with the idea of being considered “one of the good ones”, and that’s fair. That’s a good, solid topic to talk about. It doesn’t handle it PERFECTLY, cause it handles nothing perfectly. But it’s an important topic, and it handles it… okay.</p>

<p>&lt;img src=”https://imgur.com/ao8S0FJ.png” alt=”trek”</p>

<p>This episode gets very off the rails in a way I don’t like where they use their Future Calculations to determine that the Federation has absolutely zero hopes of winning this war, so it’s either surrender and save people, we just have to put up with fascism, or keep fighting and 900 billion people will die.</p>

<p>Anyways I hate how Bashir is here, a lot. It gets even MORE off the rails when the Super Brains determine that they can just send Federation secrets to the Dominion, who’d then win the war in weeks, and only two billion would die. MUCH better! Time to go betray the Federation! After all, we’re gods who can determine this!! They knock Bashir out and leave him with the mute one. She lets him go, because she likes the violent one, I guess, and Bashir convinces her that this will ruin her chances with him or some shit???</p>

<p>&lt;img src=”https://imgur.com/XqcbIrK.png” alt=”trek”</p>

<p>Anyways, Jack didn’t anticipate that, and yes, that’s the point of this. One person derailed their plans, so you can’t just guess the future using algorithms. AND YES. DUH. OF COURSE. OBVIOUSLY. WHY WAS THIS EVEN THE QUESTION?</p>

<p>Anyways this episode sucks and I kind of hate it. But I don’t really wanna go into it too much cause again, it’s a topic I’m uncomfortable even talking about.</p>

<p><strong>Statistical Probabilities</strong> - DS9
9/10</p>

<p>&lt;img src=”https://imgur.com/iN39qZW.png” alt=”trek”</p>

<p>The episode starts with Quark being his Quarky self, when he gets some bad news from the Nagus. Moogie has been kidnapped by the Dominion. Why would she be kidnapped? Not like Ferenginar is allied with the Klingons or the Federation. Who knows, doesn’t matter. What matters is Quark needs to rescue her, and he needs to put together a crackpot team of the galaxy’s best Ferengi. We’ve got Nog, obviously, his Moogie is captured. We’ve also got Rom, who is talked into it easily by being told he’ll be given Worf’s job on Quark’s ship, basically. We’ve also got a very weird Ferengi, his name is Leck. He’s an “Eliminator”, who doesn’t care about latinum, but is VERY excited to possibly kill some Dominion. And finally, Quark pays his cousin Gaila’s bail, to get him out of jail to help out. And as they’re all bickering and arguing, Ex-Liquidator Brunt shows up and offers to help, cause it might help him get his job back. No one likes him, but he has a ship, so…</p>

<p>And thus we have our team. A bartender, an outcast, a psychopath, a failed weapons dealer, a failed traitor, and the smartest man in the Alpha Quadrant that isn’t Chief O’Brien. But even Rom being with them isn’t going to help. All of their training is not working out. Leck keeps shooting Moogie after everyone else runs away, cause hey, putting her out of her misery. But Rom, again being one of the smartest people in the Quadrant, says they’re playing to their weaknesses. Time to play to their strengths. They put in some favors with the Federation to get Keevan, the Vorta who was captured a few episodes ago, to trade. And they meet up on Empek Nor, the DS9 clone. Cool!</p>

<p>&lt;img src=”https://imgur.com/88mshWk.png” alt=”trek”</p>

<p>This episode is VERY goofy and stupid, because the Ferengi are goofy and stupid, but in a great way.</p>

<p>&lt;img src=”https://imgur.com/oxi6UAw.png” alt=”trek”</p>

<p>The talks begin. It’s very Magnificent Seven, because the Ferengi all studied the movie before shooting lol. We’ve got the Vorta they’re dealing with, played by Iggy Pop, and he is dry and flat and I LOVE him. He’s VERY funny. Everything seems to be going well, actually! They make some good deals, and plan to exchange prisoners in a half hour. Unfortunately, Rom lets loose that the others aren’t getting a fair share of the payment, aaaaand shots are fires. Keevan is killed, and his last words are “I hate Ferengi”.</p>

<p>With no prisoner, what else can we do? We have one last plan…. use cortical stimulators to weekend at bernies Keevan.</p>

<p>That’s right. This is Magificent Seven meets Weekend at Bernies.</p>

<p>It’s tense, it’s a very tense situation, but they make it out, and get the element of surprise. Leck gets to kill his Jem’Hadar, which he’s VERY excited about, and they capture Iggy Pop to give to the Federation as a gift. And they leave, happily, as Keevans’ corpse walks into a wall over and over. You can actually see the actors laughing, barely able to hold themselves together as they watch him. Armin Shimmerman was having a blast, which always helps me like an episode more.</p>

<p>This episode is VERY funny, extremely enjoyable.</p>

<p>….Next week we’re gonna do DS9 to get a cycle going correctly, and TOTALLY not because next week has several Episodes Of All Time.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="DS9" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 42</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/11/04/OOCY42.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 42" /><published>2024-11-04T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-11-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/11/04/OOCY42</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/11/04/OOCY42.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/xlzZCh0.png" alt="&quot;It's just the ruels of the game.
