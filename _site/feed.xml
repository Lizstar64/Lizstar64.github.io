<p>Double Moon Densetsu interested me just cause it’s a really typical classic RPG on the NES that I had neverh eard of. Also the graphics looked kinda pretty. So I decided to give it a try. I was told it’s a pretty generic and mediocre Dragon Quest clone, and no, it’s not QUITE that, it tries for so much more than that. But also, at the same time, it’s a LOT less than that. Let’s explain.</p>

<p>The game takes place in the world of Double Moon, a world with two continents, each of which sits under the light of one of the worlds’ two moons. Years ago, your father disappeared, and today on your 15th birthday, you are informed that he went after the an evil shaman who is trying to summon an ancient evil into this world. The shaman, Samoilenko, killed your mother and kidnapped your sister years ago when you were both babies, and now you have to save her and avenge your parents! Along the journey, you’ll run into Somolienko’s cult, a large cast of villains who are causing troubles throughout the world. You need to stop them in small little vignets around the world. Stuff like… stop them from sacrificing some virgins to a dark god, or stop them and their pet turtle from destroying ships. Just random nonsense.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/xH8UEFt.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Along the way, you’ll find a large cast of characters to join you. Like, a LARGE cast. It’s like 13 characters. You are NOT going to be able to use all these characters, and in fact, the game can kinda fuck you over about this. Halfway in you get Sphinx, a… sphinx. They are not a great unit, but you will WANT to use them, because all these other characters? They will have to be sacrificed to enter the final dungeon, and the ONLY characters you’ll have are Sphinx and your main character. And if you choose a class like wizard or something, that’ll make it even harder. I was luckily warned about this.</p>

<p>This game is kinda mean. Not only that, but also things like… well, the difficult is all out of whack, honestly. In the first two dungeons, before you get a full party, you’ll run into enemies who do like, 1 damage to you, and then if they get a crit, or use a spell, boom, you’re one shot. From 100%. It’s nuts, and EXTREMELY frustrating, because unlike Dragon Quest, if you die, you restart from your last save, you DON’T respawn and just lose some money. Once you get a full party though, the game becomes kinda piss easy, and honestly a little boring. You just cast buff spells on your main character and go to town on enemies, as they get too tanky to one-shot. Then it becomes hard as hell again when you’re knocked down to you and Sphinx. The difficulty balance is all incorrect.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/juvidl6.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Other than that, the game is… perfectly fine. Fine music, if not unoriginal. Cool graphics, lots of nice big enemy sprites. And I actually really liked the story, for the most part, it was kinda engaging and interesting with cool little vignets. But the ending is absolutely nuts. So uh, spoilers for Double Moon Densetsu, a game you were totally going to play.</p>

<p>The game ends with you delving deep into the earth, deeper than anyone has gone before. You confront the evil priest who kidnapped your sister (not before killing your dad. Or not killing him if you kill the fake clones first, to get a good/neutral ending thing. It’s weird), but are too late. You defeat him, but the ritual is done, and the DARK DRAGON is summoned to the world, using your sister as a host. You have to defeat her. But the Dark Dragon cannot be killed, and must be sealed away. So you seal it away in your body… You know that its evil corrupting presence will always be there, inside you, but to save the world, you’ll make that sacrifice.</p>

<p>THIS IS THE ENDING TO DIABLO. DID THE DEVS OF DIABLO PLAY DOUBLE MOON DENSETSU??? THIS IS LITERALLY EXACTLY DIABLO, except instead of a prince it’s your sister, and also it’s all good and optimistic in the end instead of fucking dark and depressing.</p>

<p>Anyways, like a 6/10. If you REALLY like NES-style RPGs and Dragon Quest, maybe check it out, but for everyone else, it’s a skip.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="NES" /><category term="retro games" /><category term="Double Moon Densetsu" /><category term="RPGs" /><category term="obscure games" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 88</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/01/17/OOCY88.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 88" /><published>2025-01-17T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2025-01-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/01/17/OOCY88</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/01/17/OOCY88.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vYu78tQ.png" alt="&quot;Let's be best friends forever!

<p>The Magic of Scheherazade is a FASCINATING game. Made by Culture Brain, a weird-ass company who was always pushing boundaries, they’re most well known for their Little Ninja Bros/Super Chinese World series. But this is their other most well known game, a cult classic that may not have sold well, but that kept itself lodged in the brains of gamers who got to play it back in the day.</p>

<p>MoS is an RPG. What kind of RPG? <strong>Yes.</strong> It is both an action RPG in the vein of Zelda or Startropics, with a top down perspective and sword swinging action, and ALSO a turn based RPG with levels and spells and stuff.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/cL2wGRl.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>The story is pretty interesting. There’s this evil warlock, Sabaron, summoning an ancient demon, Goragora, and you’re the only person who can stop him, a powerful wizard and descendant of the ancient hero. Unfortunately, you lose before the game even starts, and your mind is wiped. But you still have your sense of justice, and even depowered, you know you must save the world, AND save the love of your life, Scheherazade, who was kidnapped by the warlock. so now, go, and save Arabia! Yeah, it’s Arabia here, and with Scheherazade, it likens itself to 1001 Nights, though it basically just makes up all of its lore, just with an ancient middle eastern style. Anyways, you are met by the Time Spirit, Coronya, a cute cat, who can take you through time to help you in your adventure.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/VfM0XCl.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>This game has a LOT of interesting systems in it. It has a class system. You can be a warrior (your sword is larger), mage (you shoot your rod faster, the best by far) or cleric (bad sword and rod, but you can block shots, worst, used only once for a quest). It has a level up system, which interestingly has a level cap that increases by 5 every chapter, and ALSO automatically levels you up if you’re behind, so no real need to grind! It has a magic system, you getting spells as you level, but ALSO you can find one super spell each chapter. It has a day-night cycle, kinda. Every now and then an eclipse happens, darkening everything and also empowering your super spells. It has a party system, you find party members who help you during quests. And it has random battles, both top down action, and also turn based. I just ran from the turn based ones. All the enemies  had too much health and you did so little damage.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/oSWMRx6.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>So, this game does it all. But as a result, it doesn’t do everything GREAT. It does it WELL! It’s… INTERESTING, and quite fun in parts, but it doesn’t really stand out as an AMAZING NES game. Just, good. All the parts of it are good. It’s a jack of all trades situation. I do recommend it, there’s a lot to enjoy about it, but it can be a little clunky at parts, it can be a little hard to figure out what to do and where to go, and some of the bosses are genuinely annoying (Looking at you, Salamander). Good game though, it’s been on my list for years and I’m glad I finally got to it.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="NES" /><category term="retro games" /><category term="Magic of Scheherazade" /><category term="obscure games" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">All images on the site seem to have died</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/updates/2025/01/16/Update.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="All images on the site seem to have died" /><published>2025-01-16T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2025-01-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/updates/2025/01/16/Update</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/updates/2025/01/16/Update.html"><![CDATA[<p>I seriously have no idea why that is.

It’s time to bring them here. So here you go. My yuri recommendations. This will need to be updated sometime, and I will. When that happens, I’ll repost it.</p>

<p><strong><em>PART 1: FINISHED WORKS</em></strong></p>

<hr />

<p>Every damn day before I go to bed, I lay in bed and read yuri until I fall asleep. And then I post cute little snippits from it (or really dumb snippits from it) onto this website for your enjoyment. And I get a lot of people who go “Liz, as the world’s leading yuri sommelier, what would you recommend?”</p>

<p>And I always say just ask and I’ll give you a yuri or two to tide you over, but someone suggested I just put that shit in a post SO I’MMA PUT THAT SHIT IN A POST</p>

<p>The following is a list of manga that I recommend, alongside a brief description and anything that might be controversial or content warningy. If you like any of these, let me know whatcha think, and consider supporting the artists and writers! You can often find a way to do that on the website I’m linking.</p>

<p>Also, this is not NEARLY a list of EVERYTHING I’d recommend, and I may add to it in the future. I’m also avoiding yuri that’s not finished or finished being translated, so there’s a LOT of amazing ones that I don’t want to get you into and then have you be sad when it never finishes getting translated. If you all like this enough, I might do another one where I recommend a bunch of yuri that’s still being worked on. I might also do another post down the line about oneshots I really like. This is ENTIRELY series.</p>

<p>Anyways, bring on the cute girls!</p>

<p><strong><em><a href="https://dynasty-scans.com/authors/nagori_yu">Yuki and the Authoress</a></em></strong></p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/kF4S3vO.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Warnings: Age gap (both adults), parental abuse</p>

<p>This is a historical story taking place either in the late Meiji era or early Taisho. Yuki is a young lower class woman working at a cafe frequented by upper class society. She’s a quiet and shy girl who lives her life between work and her books, her favorite of which are by the fluffy romance author, Azuma Beniko. So when Azuma Sensei shows up in her cafe, it overwhelms her. And then Azuma says that she wants to use Yuki as reference for her new novel…</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/krSflRf.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Read this if you like: Extreme fluff, light drama, hot women playing with soft shy women.</p>

<p>If you like this, you should read: Literally anything else written by the author, Nagori Yu. She has a type, is what I’m saying. This is, to my belief, the only thing she has ever actually FINISHED, but all of her unfinished manga that’s halfway through has this dynamic of hot powerful woman and shy cute woman.</p>

<hr />
<p><a href="https://dynasty-scans.com/series/even_if_it_was_just_once_i_regret_it">Even If It Was Just Once, I Regret It</a>
***</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/IwUz5ve.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Warnings: Oh boy, a lot. Age Gap (both adults), starts with sexual assault, power imbalance dynamics, light ecchi</p>

<p>Okay now listen, when I describe the conceit of this manga to you, you are not gonna like the sound of it. This is the hardest manga to recommend but it’s also one of my favorites, okay? Here we go.</p>

<p>Koduka-san is a game dev who has recently gotten fired from her job. She’s drowning her sorrows in alcohol, and is unable to function or pay rent. Her landlord (the manga CALLS her a landlord, and Miss Landlord, but she’s really more of a person who works at the apartment complex managing it and working with the occupants, she does not own the building) comes by to check up on her and gives her an offer on how to keep living there. The offer, at least through Koduka’s drunk haze, seems to be “sleep with me, and you can stay here”. So Koduka does.</p>

<p>Once she awakens, she immediately regrets it, and Miss Landlord gives her another offer. She can stay there with her, and if Koduka “services” her, she will consider the debt repaid.</p>

<p>Now I know how this sounds. It sounds fucking horrible. But trust me, this is actually a REALLY good manga. It’s light and fluffy, but is built on MASSIVE misunderstandings that will eventually give way to almost slice of life pleasantness as these two live together and grow closer.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/IbmrqFA.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Read this manga if you like: Lots of fluff and can put up with a bit to get there, enjoy seeing “straight” girls realize “oh shit wait why DID I immediately jump to having sex with her”, idiot couples, medium levels of drama</p>

<hr />
<p><a href="https://dynasty-scans.com/series/after_school">After School</a>
***</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/i5rGE6z.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Warnings: School girls in high school, lightly echii. Nothing explicit, but they are REALLY makin’ out.</p>

<p>Shiine and Ichika aren’t quite friends. Barely even acquaintances. They know of each other, as the other… fascinates them in a way they can’t explain, but they never had a chance to interact. However, at the start of the school year, they’re both selected as class representatives, and thus work together on the student council. After Ichika is late to a meeting, Shiine offers to help tell her what she missed, and they begin to talk to get to know each other… and the conversation goes to kissing.</p>

<p>Ichika assumes Shiine has dated and kissed COUNTLESS boys, after all, she’s so hot and cool. Shiine hasn’t but feels embarassed and embraces the lie. So Ichika wants to know… what is it like to kiss…?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/pg1JuX8.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Once the two start… they fall into a routine. Once a week, sometimes even two or three times a week, after school, the two meet up and kiss each other. They’re less than friends, but also more than friends. Kissing friends. Can they move past how they feel and become something even more?</p>

<p>Read this manga if you like: EXTREME LEVELS OF FLUFF. OVERLOAD. OVERLOAD. Girls making out with girls. Idiot couple, like holy shit REALLY BIG IDIOT COUPLE ENERGY. “THIS GIRL KEEPS ASKING ME TO MAKE OUT WITH HER EVERY DAY AFTER SCHOOL I WONDER IF SHE LIKES ME LIKE I LIKE HER”</p>

<p><a href="https://dynasty-scans.com/series/lily_love">Lily Love</a>
***</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/hNCh9Lt.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Warnings: Light to medium drama. Abusive relationships, stalking. Homophobic and abusive fathers.</p>

<p>This one is Thai, so if you read it and think the vibe is different, it very much is! And so are the names. Trust me, these are the character’s actual names in the story. This isn’t some mistranslation.</p>

<p>Donut is a young girl who is just entering college. She’s nerdy, not conventionally attractive, and has never really experienced love. One day she runs into an older student at the dorm washing machine, a cool lady named Mew. Mew is friendly, and maybe a little… flirty? No, that couldn’t be, they’re both girls! The two hit it off as friends, and find out they’re actually neighbors! What a coincidence!</p>

<p>This is a story of their friendship as it grows into something more!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/L9skYI9.png" alt="yuri" />
<img src="https://imgur.com/UjMu2eG.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Read this if you like: Girls who are more experienced picking up “straight” girls. Simple concepts. This one doesn’t have some major grand arching plot, except for some stuff involving an ex. It’s not OVERLY fluffy, but it’s good pleasant romance.</p>

***</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/fWLC8RN.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Warnings: Sexual Assault in backstory. Sick grandmothers as a plot point. Mid level drama.</p>

<p>Ms. Takase is a woman who works from home, and rarely leaves her house. She is afraid of the outside world, and others, after she was sexually assaulted at her old work, and her coworkers blamed her for it. Now she just wants nothing more than to be alone… until her delivery girl, who brings her her weekly groceries and other things, enters her life. Rinko is a bright and cheerful girl from the boonies, and while Ms. Takase is hesitant at first, they quickly become friends… or perhaps more?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/jY9mjgY.png" alt="yuri" /></p>

<p>Read this if you like: Short and sweet stories. It’s only three chapters long. Mid level drama, there’s some heavier misunderstandings, the pre-mentioned assault, and sick loved ones.</p>

<p>Warnings: Age gap, mild drama, ecchi and has some smut that’s easily skipped</p>

<p>A half human half monster girl wander the wilderness alone. She is incredibly lonely, and not mean, but her appearance causes people to run from her, and since she’s a half monster, other monsters shun her. She lives in an abandoned shack full of books she’s found, and reads them to herself. One day, however, she runs into a young girl who doesn’t run from her. Lily, the young woman, is blind. The monster, for the first time in her life, lies, and claims she is a traveler, wandering far and wide. Lily asks her to tell her stories, and the monster recounts stories from the books she’s read so that she can keep this girl as her friend. As the monster has no name, Lily names her Heath, after her favorite flower.</p>

Yayoi can’t take care of herself, and Hina comes over and cooks for her and other such things. It’s mostly cute sweet fluff, but has huge themes of age, maturity, and growing up.</p>

<p>Ayaka is a young girl in highschool who wants to be JUST like her older brother, who is the perfect student and perfect older brother. She wants to get top marks like him and go to his college, which is REALLY hard to get into… but she’s absolutely TERRIBLE at taking tests. So her teacher offers to give her a recommendation so she can get in easily, if she’ll just get the delinquent, Honda-san, to actually come to school. Honda isn’t your typical delinquent. She’s kind of a quiet emotionless girl who just… doesn’t want to come to school, possibly due to depression.</p>

<p>Honda learns of Ayaka’s deal with the teacher, which worried Ayaka. If word gets out that she’s doing favors to get a recommendation, it could kill her socially with the other students! But Honda san offers a deal. If Ayaka does whatever Honda asks her to do, once per day, then Honda won’t tell anyone. And what kind of things will Honda tell her to do?</p>

<p>Nanaki and Kanade couldn’t be further opposites. Nanaki is a gyaru who is OBSESSED with being the prettiest girl. She’s rude and forceful, and a bit of a bully. Kanade, meanwhile, is a shy and quiet otaku wallflower. However, once Nanaki is dumped brutally by her cheating boyfriend, she can’t go to any of her friends, because they’re just as cruel and as big bullies as she is. So who is there to support her and give her a shoulder to cry on? The “ugly” wallflower, Kurosawa Kanade.</p>

It’s severeled cooled on me though, especially after it just unceremoniously ended, with the artist ending it with a big sex scene that felt a little odd, after the entirely of the manga. Anyways, the description.</p>

<p>Tadokoro-san is a quiet gloomy otaku in high school. She draws manga and keeps to herself. Sakurako, meanwhile, is the school idol. She’s gorgeous, rich, and perfect in every way. So when Sakurako falls hopelessly in love with Tadokoro after seeing her art and how adorable she is, Tadokoro can’t help but be overwhelmed.</p>

But to reach that point, not even just kill the queen, you have to be top of your class. And the top of the adventurer guild’s school is none other than the mage Malori.</p>

<p>Mei-chan just graduated highschool with her heart broken. The girl she was crushing on, her best friend, is straight as can be. Now that she’s going into college she’s decided not only will she reinvent herself, but she’ll GET A GIRLFRIEND! Very quickly, however, she meets five girls that she immediately falls head over heels in love with, and they also seem to be pretty into her, each in their own ways…</p>

<p>You have Riri, the touchy snuggly sweet friend who’s a bit reserved and shy, but has a surprising past as a sexy model. There’s Maria-Sensei, a psychology professor at the college who is The Mommy type and thinks Mei is the cuttest thing in the world. Minato Senpai, a prince-like older student who’s extremely into music, sound, and especially ASMR, and immediately falls in love with Mei’s voice, and also gets Mei involved in the local arts scene. That art scene also includes Karin-Senpai, an aspiring actor who is a kiss demon playgirl who IMMEDIATELY starts making out with Mei. Then finally, there’s Mei’s roommate, the irreverent ace senpai Kaoru, who takes a liking to Mei… and has a tendency to have her Switch Get Flipped when smelling Kaoru, due to a rather strong kink.</p>

<p>No real clue where this one is going yet. It seems to ME to be a deconstruction of a lot of harem anime tropes, intentionally, and a bit of a parody of the idea, while also just being a good gay harem manga. Pretty much all the characters are fun in their own way. It’s 100% possible this will go the mythical route, the route that people like me would DREAM of seeing in a harem manga: THE POLYAMORY ROUTE. But we will have to see.</p>

<p>So, there’s a genre of manga that is very, very popular. Isekai into an otome game, where the main character falls in love with the villain of that story. I’m about to post like, three of these in a row, and they all have similar tropes and ideas, but are all good in their own ways.</p>

<p>In this one, ordinary office worker Rei wakes one day to find she’s in the body of the protagonist of her favorite otome game, Revolution. She knows this world inside and out, as she’s one of the most prolific fanfic writers of this world, so she’s researched it back and forth, especially involving her favorite character, the villainess, Vlaire Francois. The character has a tragic end in the story of the game, and Rei always wrote fanfic to change that. Now that she’s the mary sue protagonist, with incredible magic power, she will do everything in her power to protect Claire. The same Claire who hates commoners and is annoyed at Rei’s very existence.</p>

She is summoned, through her phone, to the world by the villainess, Lapis Tenenbrae, who is a cold chessmaster that Mitori knows is going to start a genocide against commoners. But Mitori, who had just been fired and was finding it hard to continue to live, now is given a new place to live, and new work to do, as her “miraculous future-telling” (she just knows the story very well) and office worker skills gets her hired by Lapis as her personal secretary. Mitori finally has a place to belong. And she decides, she’s going to do everything in her power to save Lapis and give the story a happy end.</p>

<p>I love the character designs in this. Saho is a girl on the larger side, but it’s not treated as anything more than just, what she is. It’s never mentioned or mocked. In fact, everyone loves her, she’s very sweet. Also EVERYTHING Sal makes is just, amazing.</p>

<p>This one is about one of my absolutely favorite topics in yuri, one I don’t see often. Happy families, two loving women and their kid(s). Or as Dynasty Scans calls it, uh, “non-science babies”. Dynasty Scan’s tag system is weird sometimes.</p>

<p>Hina is a young pre-schooler who gets into a spat with her overworked and exhausted mother, who isn’t even LISTENING to her! Her mom’s wife, Ric-chan, tried to teach her how important her mother is, but she’s so young. It’s a fluffy and sweet loving family, and like all families, they have some rough spots now and then, but they’ll make it through, to a sunny tomorrow.</p>

<p>Rin is a young girl who’s confessed to by a girl! That’s weird, isn’t it, a girl liking another girl? Uh no, of course not. After all, Rin has two moms. Why would that be weird?</p>

<p>More cute family stuff.</p>

<p>CW: Age Gap, kinda? In like, both ways. You’ll see what I mean.</p>

<p>Fussa is an actual IRL city in Japan, which has a US military base on it. One day, while walking by the chain link fence seperating the two countries, Risa meets a young American girl named Delphi living on the other side. The two, despite not speaking each other’s languages, want to become closer! Can they cross both the language barrier, and the actual physical barrier, and become closer?</p>

<p>I love language barrier stuff and international love (I wonder why this is so important to me huh), so this one hits me in a good way.</p>

<p>CW: Technically age gap, they’re both adults but Meg is apparently an ancient and powerful witch, though she just looks like a young woman.</p>
