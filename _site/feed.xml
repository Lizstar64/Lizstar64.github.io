<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p>IT’S BEEN A LOOOOONG ROOOOOAAAD</p>

<p><strong>First Flight</strong> - ENT
7/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/s8Vjp6y.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Archer is lookin’ at some cool Dark Matter, and then gets a call from Admiral Forrest about some guy named A.G. who died climbing Mount McKinley. Archer is super bummed about it and wants to go on the Dark Matter mission by himself, some alone time, but T’Pol forces her way on. She’s just worried about him, it’s sweet. Archer tells her about him.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/0Won53j.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We get a flashback to something called the NX-Project, a warp engine. It seems like a long while ago (seven years apparently), but uh, Archer is old as hell still, even though he’s trying to act the part of a younger man. A.G. isn’t much better. Archer is called in and told that A.G, another captain, is being given the assignment to pilot Enterprise instead. A.G. is pretty boastful about it. Turns out they weren’t really ‘friends’ per se, more rivals.</p>

<p>The test flight goes… poorly. A.G. claims he got the job because he doesn’t play by the book, and he decides to push the engine way past where it should be while everyone is like “Uh dog, your ship is gonna collapse if you do this”. It fucking does. It explodes alongside Jupiter. Everyone assumes he dies, which like… this would be more suspensful if we didn’t know he already survived this.</p>

<p>Oh of COURSE Trip is here. He claims he’s working under Captain Jeffries. Eh, a little nod. They get A.G. back, and he tells off the Vulcans, of course. Oh my GOD they explain Trip’s nickname. He’s the third Charles Tucker, so he’s the triple one. Trip. They fucking Han Solo’d Trip, but like, in series. I dunno if that really counts actually.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/tC0y5nz.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>A.G. and Archer get in a scuffle cause A.G. claims it was his father’s shitty engine that caused the problems, and not him refusing to listen to others. He’s kinda clearly in the wrong here, ESPECIALLY cause we know the engine is fine <strong>because we’re watching a show right now where the engine is letting them move at warp 5</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/5ed07F2.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Archer concedes to A.G. about this for some reason, I don’t get it. Especially cause he proves through some telemetry that they can easily fix this problem, but the Vulcans want the Humans grounded. They just needed to prove it. So A.G. convinces Archer to steal the second test ship and fly it himself. He also promises Trip that he’ll put him on his ship if he gets a big one. Thanks for that, Archer. The flight works, proving the ship can fly. The Vulcans can’t dispute that. Though this stunt pisses everyone off, and they’re grounded for months. Got off SHOCKINGLY light. I think the higher ups agreed, prolly.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/S5HpbFX.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Anyways Archer finishes his story and we get a conclusion to the Dark Matter story, where they make the dark matter explode and light up all pretty. They name it after A.G. and move on.</p>

<p>The framing story is kinda poorly paced, but it was cute, I liked it. Also its nice to have actual world building for Enterprise.</p>

<p><strong>Bounty</strong> - ENT
2.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/1HIoxjj.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Holy SHIT a Tellerite. This is the first time we’re seeing them in a very, VERY long time. One episode of TOS.</p>

<p>A Tellerite finds Enterprise above a planet, and is super friendly. Offers to come over and show them some things he’s found about the planet. He IMMEDIATELY shoots Trip and Archer and abducts the captain.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/dGpcohL.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>You know what this episode where our captain is kidnapped needed? A long, sensual scene where we get T’Pol and Phlox in decon rubbing gel on each other. Holy SHIT, Berman. This is by far the most egregious decon scene we’ve seen. I knew there’d be lots of these, but was expecting more tbh. There haven’t been many lately. I know they’re supposed to stop soon but we get one last one… and worst of all? T’Pol is acting…. weird.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Archer tries talking to the Tellerite about this. Apparently he’s been abducted by a bounty hunter working for the Klingons. Archer DID escape from prison, after all. The Tellerite isn’t a HUGE asshole. He’s like “Look, I’m sure you’re not a bad person, just an unlucky one. But I need the money. Sorry.”</p>

<p>T’Pol is getting VERY emotional. God please don’t be what I think it is.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/0z36wbb.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Fucking christ on the cross, it is.</p>

<p>Hey, remember when Spock and Tuvok underwent pon’far on screen and started acting like sexy little kittens, trying to seduce and mewl?</p>

<p>I’d watch that episode actually. Hmm.</p>

<p>Credit where its due, T’Pol’s actor is putting everything she has into it. She’s not like Troi’s actress, where if she gets something sexist and dumb she just kinda shuts down. She’s playing the horny Sex Kitten very effectively, but it fucking sucks. At least it’s with Phlox and not Trip. Can you fucking imagine? I’d have given this a 1 and left the room. Phlox is VERY professional about all of this.</p>

<p>The painful thing is the Tellerite storyline is actually quite good. This Tellerite captain’s got pathos. He made a small mistake, which is only a crime to the Klingons, and his ship was impounded by the Klingons and he was lucky to escape with his life. Gee, does that sound like anyone? It’s a good story. And even when it’s clear that things aren’t going to go well, and he’s never gonna get his ship that was stolen from him back from the Klingons, if he helps Archer he’ll just be killed. And of course they only give him 2/3rds of what he was told he’d get. Of course. I know Klingons are often dickheads but wow. Before Archer is taken though, the Tellerite gives him a lockpick so he can try to escape, and then tells the Enteprise where to find Archer.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/2T3HSZd.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The conclusion to the T’Pol storyline is she breaks out and runs around trying to fuck anyone she can while sweating and screaming. She’s shot and knocked out. Rick Berman should be in jail.</p>

<p>Oh, Archer shot some people with a stolen Klingon gun. Those don’t have a stun setting. Add that to his list of Klingon Crimes. Anyways he escapes. The Tellerite tells him to be safe, and it ends.</p>

<p>The A plot had a great setup but not a very good payoff, and the B plot was absolutely fucking awful.</p>

<p><strong>The Expanse</strong> - ENT
4/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/kfX6jvN.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Apparently this episode will completely toneshift the show and setup the third season, is is supposedly VERY different. I’m ready. God, I’m ready for ANYTHING different.</p>

<p>Our episode starts with an unknown probe blowing up Florida. I was cheering. Then the probe hit Cuba, and I was like “NO NO, SHIT”. Meanwhile, the Klingons go “WE NEED TO STOP THAT DASTARDLY ARCHER” and send Duras after him. When Archer learns of the attack, he’s recalled back to Earth. Trip is DEVESTATED. He IS from Florida, after all. His sister might have been among the 3 million casualties. And then suddenly, the Suliban attack and Archer is suddenly kidnapped. Wow this episode is paced REALLY fast.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/u7B4XY2.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The Shadowy Figure is here! Remember him? He’s the Palpatine-ass mother fucker who’s a player in the Temporal Cold War, and has the Suliban working for him. He’s surely going to be important, right? Nope! This is his last appearance! :D But even though we never learn who he is, we know who he was SUPPOSED to be. Guess! It’s fucking Archer, from the future, apparently. That’s dumb, but it’s dropped so who cares.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/T61jd9o.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Anyways Palpatine tells Archer that the attack was by the Xindi. They are aliens who learned that their planet will be destroyed by Earth in 400 years, so they’re trying to kill the Humans now to stop it. Archer returns home and is attacked by Duras, but he’s pushed off. Man this episode REALLY has a bad pacing problem. They’re trying to cram so much in so quickly. When he returns home, they learn where the Xindi are. The Xindi are apparently in an area called The Delphic Expanse, a giant region in the beta quadrant that is dangerous and barely explored.</p>

<p>The Vulcans are as awful as usual, sending some weirdo to try and declare Archer mentally unwell cause he’s talking about time travel. He lies about who he is and why he’s there to do this. Phlox is PISSED. “Where is your sense of medical ethics?!” “I’m just doing what I’m told.” YEAH DUDE THAT’S ALWAYS A GOOD EXCUSE.</p>

<p>Trip finds out his sister was killed in the attack, and becomes super pissy about it. I get it, but 2 seasons of Trip being the worst character, now him becoming a super angsty angry mother fucker… I don’t appreciate it.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/6cCTSIl.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Everyone gets to decide if they can stay on Enterprise… except for one person. T’Pol doesn’t get a choice. She WANTS to stay on board, and is kind of pissed. No one is happy to see her go. Except maybe Trip. Also everyone gets a scene about if they should stay, except for Mayweather and Hoshi. Hoshi HAD one but it was removed from the episode. Of course. Who cares about her, right??</p>

<p>Oh good. Trip is like “It’s a good thing she’s leaving, she’s push for noninterference, and we need to kill all of the Xindi” OKAY DUDE. YEAH, WE SHOULD KEEP HIM ON BOARD, THAT’S A GREAT FUCKING IDEA. He’s VERY Starfleet!</p>

<p>Enterprise is retrofitted and heads out, and is immediately attacked by Duras again. But Enterprise took a level up and easily kicks their asses.</p>

<p>T’Pol announces she’s resigning her commission and quitting the High Command to stay on Enterprise. Ey, first Vulcan in Starfleet? :o The Vulcans are NOT gonna like that.</p>

<p>You know what we need? A THIRD FIGHT WITH THE KLINGONS. Duras gets other Klingons to chase Archer with him, but they flee from the Expanse cause it’s scawy. Duras chases after him, cause I mean clearly nothing’s deterring him from this… I dunno why he’s even still here, the Klingons at teh start said “YOU HAVE ONE MORE CHANCE DURAS” and then gave him three fucking chances in this episode. Well, Archer FINALLY decides to kill Duras, blowing up his ship. Bout time.</p>

<p>And then they move into the Expanse, the end.</p>

<p>This episode’s pacing was bad. Hopefully this is not an omen of things to come.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="Enterprise" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">LizstarTrek - Enterprise Season 3 episodes 1-2</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/lizstartrek/2025/11/23/LizstartrekEnt3-1.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="LizstarTrek - Enterprise Season 3 episodes 1-2" /><published>2025-11-23T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2025-11-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/lizstartrek/2025/11/23/LizstartrekEnt3-1</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/lizstartrek/2025/11/23/LizstartrekEnt3-1.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ENM6YGs.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p>IT’S BEEN A LOOOOONG ROOOOOAAAD</p>

<p>Welcome to season 3. Berman and Braga will be taking the backseat… but not yet, sadly.</p>

<p><strong>The Xindi</strong> - ENT
2.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/s8Vjp6y.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We get a scene to start with a council of a bunch of aliens, many very different designs. I like em! They’re like WE MUST FIND AND STOP THE HUMANS.</p>

<p>And then we get the theme song and what the fuck?? They completely changed the instrumentation. It was apparently made more upbeat and chipper. It’s a weird guitar, and the voicework sounds like they isolated it from the original recording so it’s weird as shit, almost like it’s missing some tones. But either way, why the FUCK would you want to make this more upbeat and chipper? It’s a fucking 9/11 allergory, what the shit are you doing</p>

<p>Okay, a few important notes. 1) Archer is weirdly grumpy and angry. Joy. And 2) There are some new characters!! MARINES. Yep, Archer asked for some marines to come on board. They’re fine enough for now, but god. This shit is 9/11 vibes, isn’t it?? Military, oh boy. That goes so well with Starfleet. They’re members of MACO, the Military Assault Command Operations.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/8XlGfpY.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They get a meeting with some miner foreman. He appears to snort liquid platinum, and wants it in exchange to talk to a Xindi that works in the mines. The Xindi comes up and is like “Yeah uh, we’re treated like slaves here. Get me out of here, and I’ll tell you my planet’s coordinates.” Trip attacks him. I am very much not looking forward to a season of angsty angry Trip and Archer. Anyways the Foreman betrays them and locks them down there, but the Xindi works with them to help them get out.</p>

<p>He explains that there are five distinct species of Xindi, which all look different. And none are dominant over the others, but there are arguments. Phlox mentioned that the DNA was weird. His DNA, this human-like one, is related to the lizard corpse they found, but not 100%. Weird. I don’t think thats how that works.</p>

<p>The escape plan fails, but they’re rescued by THE MARINE! RAH RAH! LOTS of people die in the process. We even get a girl marine fighting someone! Holy shit what? Anyways the Xindi is shot just outside the ship, which Neli called and got VERY angry that she was right about.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/6SImuPd.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They treat this guy like shit, go “WE’RE GONNA LEAVE YOU BEHIND” after he’s annoying and tries to throw them under the bus to save his own skin. Dude he’s your only lead. Anyways, he gives the coordinates before he dies. Okay.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/C2IHTqX.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Oh no. Ohhh no. Oh no oh no oh no. They’re gonna push this romance aren’t they? She uh, teaches him some Klingon Neuropressure… in order to try and help him sleep. But it’s clearly sexual and romantic and I am going to fucking scream. Why <strong><em>DOES EVERY WOMAN IN SPACE WANT TO FUCK THIS FUCKING GUY</em></strong></p>

<p>JUST PUT T’POL AND ARCHER TOGETHER FOR GOD’S SAKE. IF YOU’RE NOT GOING TO DO THE CORRECT THING AND PUT HER AND HOSHI TOGETHER.</p>

<p>The episode ends with the Insect Xindi being overly aggressive. Of course they’re the aggressive ones.</p>

<p>I don’t like this. A very, VERY bad omen.</p>

<p><strong>Anomaly</strong> - ENT
3.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/uGLEJmu.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Enterprise suddenly gets the shit beat out of it by some anomalies. Apparently there are some weird anomalies in the expanse that break the laws of physics. Are they ever gonna be explained? I highly doubt it. They limp along and find an alien ship that has no atmosphere and no biosigns. Archer, Reed, and some nameless marines go aboard. They find corpses. Two days ago. Whatever killed them is still nearby.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Eso9rv0.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Aliens come aboard and attack. It then becomes a  bunch of action sequences, of Enterprise characters trying to stop the pirates who are attacking. The pirates steal a bunch of cargo before teleporting out, though one of them is stunned and captured.</p>

<p>Archer is still a weirdly angy little pissant, acting kinda pissy towards T’Pol. He goes down to talk to the pirate they captured. He’s like “you can’t torture me for the info, you’re too soft. You have too much morals” and Archer goes “There’s too much at stake. I don’t have time for morals.” Don’t like that. Really do not like that. This ain’t gonna be no In The Pale Moonlight.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/z6rK2fC.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Enterprise chases the pirates, and finds a weird anomaly. Inside of it, they find some kind of giant manmade object. A giant sphere in space. They take a shuttle inside, finding a big door, and find some tubes moving large energy through, as well as some ports with breathable atmosphere inside. They find the pirate’s stash inside, with all the stolen shit and a bunch of other stuff which they take.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/JQlR7T4.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Archer continues to be EXTREMELY fucking angry. He realizes the prisoner might know anything about the Xindi, and fucking screams at him, drags him to the airlock, and almost kills him. The prisoner then gives him all the info he wants about his pirate friends and the Xindi. Torture! It works!</p>

<p>Do you all like those episodes where the captain you know and love gets really angry and become Ahab-y? How about a whole mother fucking season of that? Now, since the show has really constant continuity, this MIGHT turn out to be something good in the long run, as Archer realizes he can’t lose his humanity for this. But uh, I fucking hate this. I didn’t even like Archer that much to be honest? He’s already my least favorite captain, I think, but this is pretty bad, frankly.</p>

<p>The codes and info he gets works, and they defeat the pirate, so they let the captive go. The captive mocks them about it. Alright dude. The episode ends with data they downloaded from the pirates flashing across Archer’s face as he looks at a screen. How the fuck could you get ANY information from that?</p>

<p>This is not making me confident about the season.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="Enterprise" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 198</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/11/18/OOCY198.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 198" /><published>2025-11-18T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2025-11-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/11/18/OOCY198</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/11/18/OOCY198.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/KBALRgX.png" alt="'" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Man, remember when Portal was the only thing that mattered? This is actually from a bit beyond that. This is a homebrew from 2016 by Ashley Samuelson, and is probably just a personal project thing. Yep, it’s yet another Homebrew game. I sometimes like to check these out because they’re often really short and easy, and sometimes you find some interesting stuff with them!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/5TPTLvS.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>I don’t really have much to comment on here, though. You play as a Companion Cube that can slide around and jump. You eventually obtain your own portal gun, but there are only like 10-15 screens. It’s really more of a beta than anything else. There’s no music or sound effects, probably because the GBA’s sound setup is hell on earth. None of the screens are super complex, because it’s 2D, so you don’t get any of the wild puzzle setups you could get in the original Portal, or especially Portal 2.</p>

<p>It’s a cute little thing for like 10 minutes, though.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Gameboy Advance" /><category term="Homebrew" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 197</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/11/16/OOCY197.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 197" /><published>2025-11-16T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2025-11-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/11/16/OOCY197</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/11/16/OOCY197.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/2FtRkPu.png" alt="'" class="center-block" /></p>

If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p>IT’S BEEN A LOOOOONG ROOOOOAAAD</p>

<p><strong>Judgement</strong> - ENT
8/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/JntZ4rP.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Our episode starts with Archer dragged in chains in front of a Klingon tribunal, claiming he’s accused of crimes of sabotage against the empire. He pleads not guilty.</p>

<p>Some of the best Trek episodes are Klingon Law episodes. <strong>Please be good.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/KvcifXo.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Archer is being defended by Not-Martok here. Archer is being accused by someone named Duras… that name is important. Duras says he was going after Klingon traitors, who were on the Enteprise. When he demanded they be handed over, Archer said “No, I’ve made an alliance with these people, back away now or join your ancestors in the afterlife”. I’m starting to think Archer didn’t actually say these things! Archer also fires first. When Archer objects, he’s yelled at, as that is against the rules of the tribunal. Ahh, kangaroo courts. Not-Martok (his name is Kolos) defends ARcher very poorly, and Archer gets tazed for trying to defend himself.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/xIEDm2t.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Kolos is an old attorney, and has been doing this for a while, and he’s pretty pissed at what they’re doing. But he’s doing his best to get Archer found guilty so he can make his sentence less violent. Archer calls him out on it. He’s afraid of it, but he ends up stepping up to the plate after all.</p>

<p>Archer tells his side of the story, after Kolos argues for it. He found some Klingon civilians who were fleeing the empire after their colony was abandoned by the empire. They are willing to help them, and then Duras shows up. They are ready to defend their ship, but not violent of course. All the while the prosecutor is mocking and claiming he’s a violent savage who has declared war on the empire, all nonsense. Of course, when Duras shows up, Archer is like “Hey, let’s sit down and try to=” and is immediately fired upon.</p>

<p>Something I’ve noticed from Enterprise is that it keeps reusing old ideas. A Klingon tribunal episode with some Klingons who are corrupt and self serving, desiring violence and aggression, and the few noble Klingons willing to work things out helping out.</p>

<p>Kolos eventually is like “If Archer is guilty, he’s guilty of being a nuisance”, and uses the fact that Archer has help Klingons a lot recently to show that he’s clearly not an enemy of the Empire, and has no interest in starting a rebellion or war with it. While they’re waiting for the outcome, Kolos is like “you don’t expect Klingons to all be warriors?” “Yeah, kinda”. This is it! This is the episode that’s like “What the fuck, no, of course Klingons have things that aren’t warriors”. His dad was a teacher. Hell yeah. Teachers have honor.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/BPTHZfO.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Archer is guilty, but because of his help for the Empire in the past, he won’t be killed. He’s just going to be sent to Rura Penthe for the rest of his life. Hey, that’s the place from Star Trek 6! Nice. Kolos is PISSED, and declares that that IS death, life expectancy there is like six months. He declares the court has no honor and is thrown to Rura Penthe for a year, too. Whoops.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/W08ovIr.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Reed comes to break them out. Kolos refuses to go with him. He’s spent 50 years being an advocate, and 20 years of that holding his tongue and sending honorable men to places like this. He’s going to survive that year and change things. Shine on, you beautiful Klingon.</p>

<p>That was just a good episode. Thank god.</p>

<p><strong>Horizon</strong> - ENT
8/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/QWmvxKt.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Holy <em>shit</em>, a Mayweather episode???</p>

<p>In my Discord, we have a meme sticker based on a random Memory Alpha image.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Li66WeQ.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>I dunno why but it tickles me. I hope this episode is just this for 28 minutes. Enterprise passed by the Horizon, Mayweather’s family’s ship, then coming back soon after. So Mayweather asks to visit his dad, since he’s sick. Unfortunately, before he can get to the ship, he discovers the news. His dad actually passed away six weeks ago, but he never got the news. Mayweather is DEVESTATED, especially cause they didn’t leave on good terms. His dad was unhappy he left the barge. Genuinely fantastic scene with Archer, where he tells Mayweather about a letter his dad sent telling him to hire his son. “I’ve never met a better stick and rudder man and you’d be a fool not to choose him”. Genuinely great scene.</p>

<p>The B-plot in this episode seems to be “T’Pol is convinced to watch horror movies with the crew”. Usually I’d hate B-plot nonsense like that but I kinda love this idea and I hope she likes them. They’re watching Frankenstein.</p>

<p>I really hope this episode continues to just be Mayweather spending time with his family in a slow, chill, slice of life way. He meets his mom and brother, now acting captain. It’s still his old home, but he kind of has a new home now, it’s a good kind of story to tell. But I’m afraid there’s gonna be a thing like they try to kidnap him or they need his help through some major problem.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/qEnWetr.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>YES, TRIP, THAT’S WHAT MARY SHELLEY IS KNOWN FOR. THAT’S WHAT’S MOST IMPORTANT ABOUT HER. THAT SHE’S THE WIFE OF A FAMOUS POET. YOU FUCKING HACK.</p>

<p>No one but me can name a fucking Percy Shelley poem, and I have a fucking degree. But everyone knows Frankenstein. Go fuck yourself, dog.</p>

<p>Things aren’t all peachy on the Horizon. Mayweather’s brother is a nice enough guy but he’s tense, and not really ready for this. He also gets testy at Mayweather for overstepping his new captain duties (Mayweather was SUPPOSED to take the captain job, so there’s some bad blood there). An old crush of Mayweather’s tells him things are tense and he’s not a great captain. And then they’re attacked.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/2FwGlkk.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The pirates have a VERY weird strategy. Plant a beacon on a ship, then send a really big scary ship to demand the cargo later. Mayweather goes above his brother again and they get into a fight. There’s still lots of grumpiness there, but his mom is like “ah give him time, you’re doing good shit”</p>

<p>Holy shit. “What did you think of the movie?” “I found the main character interesting.” “Doctor Frankenstein, huh?” “No, the creation” “…that’s one way of looking at it”. YES, TRIP. I SUPPOSE THAT IS ONE WAY OF LOOKING AT IT, SURE. AND BY ONE WAY I MEAN THE FUCKING ONLY WAY, YOU GOD DAMN HACK. THAT’S THE FUCKING POINT OF THE MOVIE. Anyways she’s like “the villager’s reactions remind me of Vulcan first contact, I’ll suggest Soval show this to every Vulcans arriving on Earth.” Very funny.</p>

<p>The pirates come around and the Captain’s plans to deal with them by giving them everything don’t work, so they have to rely on Mayweather’s strategy. It works, smooths things over with the brothers, and they part on good terms.</p>

<p>Again, another good episode. Holy shit, two in a row.</p>

<p><strong>The Breach</strong> - ENT
6.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/13wMY35.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Holy shit, Phlox has a tribble. Imagine that. Well, he has one to feed to one of his pets. Which he does violently. It freaks Hoshi out.</p>

<p>Anyways, he gets a message and asks Archer for help. Three Denobulans are on a planet that recently fell under a new government, an extremely xenophobic one. Trip, Reed, and Mayweather have three days to go down, find them, extract them, and get the hell out before they are considered illegal and arrested. Meanwhile, they rescue a ship that is exploding above the planet, and Phlox has to treat the crew, one of which he seems apprehensive about. Uh oh!</p>

<p>Reed and Trip are so fucking incompetent, why do they outrank Mayweather?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/B9stI31.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We found out the problem. The patient is Antaran, and apparently they and the Denobulans were at war a few times, and they were very bitter disputes. The last war was 300 years ago, but there is VERY bad blood. The Antaran refuses to be treated by him, and would rather die. Archer orders Phlox to perform the surgery anyway, but Phlox refuses, because uh, that’s how medical ethics works. Archer tries to force him, but Phlox refuses. Also he outranks the captain on medical issues anyway, Archer?? There are two kinds of Archer. Good, honorable Archer…. and Angy Archer. We’ve got Angy Archer today. Boo.</p>

<p>Apparently the Denobulans did some REALLY sketchy strategies in their war and killed a shiiiiit ton of Antarans. 20 million of them. Phlox admits it is not a proud history, but one they try to move past. But also, it seems like his side isn’t willing to try and reconcile either.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/grjeSiH.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>You know what this episode about racism needed? Cave slapstick. It doesn’t help that we can barely see anything cause of the lighting. And of course Mayweather is the one to get hurt, but also save everyone’s lives.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/FCF7Ud8.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The Antaran treats Phlox like shit, and he gets fed up and leaves. The Antaran is now like “Ha ha I win, I proved that he’s not the perfect goody twoshoes he claims to be”. And he’s going to die. Congrats on your victory, dude.</p>

<p>Phlox talks to T’Pol about this. When he was a kid, he wanted to go to a beautiful planet. His grandma told him not to go, because the Antarans had once lived there, even though it was a very long time ago, and now the planet was tained. He didn’t go. But when he had kids of his own, he took them there. Because he didn’t want them raised like he was raised. Phlox is, in fact, actually a good person. But he has internal biases from being raised as such. But he refuses to let them continue.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/WqUvpXX.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Trip and Reed make their way to the Denobulans deep in the cave, who are like “Thanks but we’re good, we don’t want to leave”. Good thing they sent the two diplomats here! Trip orders them up at gunpoint. Oh good. Glad that’s the end to this storyline. A shaggy dog story that makes Trip look like even more of an asshole.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/jvSQhIr.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Phlox explains to the Antaran about his family. He has five kids. He tried to teach them to be better than his grandmother was. All are, except one, who was persuaded to far right xenophobic politics. Phlox stopped talking to him because of this. His racist son would want nothing more than for Phlox to just let him die. But he doesn’t want to. Eventually he agrees to the procedure, and has his life saved.</p>

<p>We did it! We solved racism!</p>

<p>Everyone goes their seperate ways, and the episode ends with Phlox writing to his son, hoping it changes something in him.</p>

<p>The episode was pretty good for the most part… but the cave plot was unneccesary and bad.</p>

<p><strong>Crogenitor</strong> - ENT
2/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/3n85v7P.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Before this episode started, we took a break to make popcorn. I read this episode’s description and found out it’s about gender.</p>

<p>I got some whisky. I might need it.</p>

<p>Enterprise is studying a hypergiant star. While there, they discover a ship floating along nearby. They talk, and are very friendly! They offer to help trade info, and are excited to become friends, they’re a very nice species and are almost like Humans in their xenophilic stance… except one thing. While chatting up the captain, Trip says  hello to one, who seems shocked by the hello. They explain its a “Crogenitor”, they’re trying to have a baby.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/kv4xvEX.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Trip is confused, and talks to Phlox. They’re a three gendered species, the crogenitor is used for mating. They use it/its pronouns apparently. Phlox has pictures, and is excited to share them! Trip is not interested… until he talks to the captain, who wants to share info about his engine, but all Trip wants to know about is their Crogenitor. They are a bit weirded out by him asking about it.</p>

<p>Trip is REALLY hung up on this. Specifically, he’s hung up on the fact that they appear to treat this Crogenitor like dirt. It has no rights. He comes to T’Pol about it who’s like “the captain wants a working relationship with them, it’s not our problem” and Phlox goes “It’s not our problem, it’s their society and reproductive system”. I’m honestly stunned this is their reaction to a blatant problem. There’s clearly a slavery type situation happening here and they’re ignoring it cause hey we might make friends. Why would you WANT to be their friend? Trip has the right idea IMO, but he handles it in the WORST, CLUNKIEST WAY. He has NO tact, NO grace, and no understanding that he’s wading into a mother fucking minefield. It’s straight up punishment to watch.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/nCzbFQY.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>He sneaks around the ship and tries to teach it how to read. It’s confounded by this. Like, this episode isn’t offensive, cause it has the right idea, it’s just poorly written, and frankly unable to meet the moment. It should be NO surprise Brennan and Braga wrote this. They are a plague upon Star Trek.</p>

<p>Trip is THE WORST FUCKING CHARACTER TO HAVE DONE THIS.</p>

<p>This episode also is REALLY overloaded. There’s a C-plot. A: This third gender thing. B: Archer and his new boyfriend explore the sun. C: Reed gets a new girlfriend. He’s totally straight, guys.</p>

<p>Pauline in my chat described this episode pretty well. This is not an episode about a mistreated slave class. This is a white savior episode. It’s not really about the slave itself. It’s about Trip being the white savior. It’s like the opposite side of the Harry Potter SPEW shit, and I’m sorry for bringing that up, but its like the opposite of that and it’s just as well written. Trip has ALL the agency here, and that feels bad.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/jMUVDCl.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Excuse me I need to be a pedantic Trek nerd for a second. Yes it’s fun to have Dixon Hill here, but Bride of Chaotica? THAT SHIT WAS WRITTEN BY TOM PARIS LIKE 200 YEARS AFTER THIS. 0/10.</p>

<p>Or maybe this has EXTREME implications for lore???</p>

<p>Trip names it (calls it her, so I will call her her, but he only calls her her cause she has an actress so whatever) Charles. Charles learns VERY fast and realizes it has a shitty life and asks for asylum. Archer thinks about it, which stresses his new friends and stresses relations, but eventually denies asylum. For some reason. I guesss so the episode can happen. They leave on tense, but still friendly terms… until Archer learns that Charles committed suicide.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ENM6YGs.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>YES, TRIP, IT IS.</p>

<p>Archer tore him apart about this, telling him that his impulsive actions killed someone. Trip, at least, is kinda traumatized by this. I hope this means Trip will cool off with his impulsive bullshit but I am not confident.</p>

<p>Bad. I can see ways this could be good. As Neli says, “an episode where Trip’s bumbling incompetence and impulsive bullshit causes him to fuck up first contact, and pushing to form a prime directive, can be good, but ALL the framing is very bad”. And I agree 100%.</p>

<p><strong>Regeneration</strong> - ENT
3/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/7lwvERz.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Oh Christ. I was so worried this is something we were going to do.</p>

<p>In the arctic, some researches find a crashed alien ship. They find aliens under the ice. Humanoids with cybernetics where their eye should be. YEP. A BORG EPISODE. 200 years before Borg First Contact. And we can thank the movie First Contact for this. It’s creating suffering long after its creation. Fucking garbage-ass movie. Anyways, what follows is basically The Thing. They’re studying the Borg, wondering wtf their deal is, as the nanotechnology begins to repair systems. Dude. They’ve been dead for literally 100 years. I don’t give a shit HOW good Borg technology are, they cannot <strong>bring themselves back to life after dying a hundred years ago in a ship crash</strong>. And if they DID have that technology it wouldn’t be in random fucking drones, they’re replacable.</p>

<p>I’m not a fan of late-stage Borg, but now it’s even MORE late-stage Borg. People complain about Voyager? This is FAR worse.</p>

<p>The dude in charge says “let’s not freeze them again even though it might be dangerous, we can learn so much from them,” and is killed because of it. Good job, dog.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/aw3zAAY.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Enterprise is sent after the Borg when it escapes on the researcher’s ship, kidnapping them as well. Enterprise finds the Borg attacking a vessel, and saves them, but they were already injected with nanoprobes. Meanwhile, Archer finds that Cochrane talked about the Borg once while drunk.</p>

<p>The aliens wake up, are like “WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?” and then for some fucking reason IMMEDIATELY act like Borg, even though they’re not fully turned. They immediately can tubule Phlox, who’s infected with the nanoprobes now. That’s not how indocrination works.</p>

<p>I’m starting to think this episode is dumb. This isn’t consistant with normal Trek, OR with First Contact’s terrible stupid interpretation of the Borg as like, zombies.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/MXEaBfF.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The Borg tubules a computer and it magically morphs into a Borg system. What in the mother fuck? They also have energy shielding already. What in the WORLD. Archer has to send them out of the airlock, he’s extremely unhappy about it, but he intends to recover them, and save anyone if he can. Phlox, for the record, makes a fucking poison and goes “if I can’t cure this with this treatment I’m designing, kill me with this, thank you, I do not intend to turn into one of those”.</p>

<p>They find the Borg, and they manage to overpower Enterprise, of course. They then send a message. “YOU WILL BE ASSIMILATED. RESISTANCE IS FUTILE”. Notice, if you will, that they did NOT add “WE ARE THE BORG” at the start. Which is an important notable omission. They are desperate to maintain continuity here, but dude. Maybe if you need to work this hard to maintain continuity by CHANGING THE WAY THE BORG WORK IN EVERY WAY, YOU SHOULDN’T HAVE DONE THIS EPISODE.</p>

<p>Archer and Reed beam over, but don’t worry, it’s fine. They updated their weapons and made them powerful enough to take out the Borg. Dude. They couldn’t do that in VOYAGER, WITH A BORG ON THEIR SIDE, WHY CAN THEY DO THAT NOW????? They also disable a Borg Drone by pulling the tubules out of their heads. Wow its really fucking easy to kill a Drone.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/xhQkDme.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Archer decides he can’t save anyone on the ship, and sets a bomb. The ship is damaged, but alive, and they send over the borg they used to invade Enterprise to fix it. For some reason. That’s very dumb, cause Enterprise just blows it up and kills all of the Borg, gg.</p>

<p>Also Phlox is fine, he just had to suffer through a dangerous radiation bath. He warns them that the Borg were sending a message. somewhere deep in the Delta Quadrant… coordinates of Earth. If that ever comes back… it doesn’t. It’s not important.</p>

<p>This sucked. However, here’s a thing:</p>

<p>“The events of this episode form the basis of the story for the 2006 game Star Trek: Legacy. A Vulcan scientist named T’Uerell is assigned to study the Borg debris and after learning their true nature, injects herself with Borg nanoprobes. Armed with knowledge of future events, she spends the next two centuries building her forces and waiting for the opportunity to seize control of the Borg Collective in order to use them to bring a state of total logic to the Alpha Quadrant.”</p>

<p>what</p>

<p>Was that game any good? I doubt it.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="Enterprise" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 196</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/11/15/OOCY196.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 196" /><published>2025-11-15T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2025-11-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/11/15/OOCY196</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/11/15/OOCY196.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/eokLcgP.png" alt="'" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p>IT’S BEEN A LOOOOONG ROOOOOAAAD</p>

<p><strong>Stigma</strong> - ENT
1/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/a542LeL.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Are you ready for YET ANOTHER EPISODE with an alien of the week who’s REALLY horny for Trip for no fucking reason while he continues to be a dumbass at her? Oh boy, AM I!</p>

<p>The episode starts with Phlox telling her the treatment is no longer working and she might die, so they need to contact the Vulcans for help. What’s this for? Well, we’ll see. Meanwhile, one of Phlox’s wives is here to help them install a microscope or something. She’s friendly, and is CLEARLY attracted to Trip for, once again, reasons I do NOT understand. Oh wait, I do understand. Trip is Berman’s self insert character, and so all the women have to want to fuck him. She’s coming on strong, and I like a woman who knows what she wants, but it’s the fact it’s Trip, AND Trip has gotten SO MUCH action. He’s had like, 5 alien women want to bone down so far. We’re halfway through season 2. Riker had maybe that many women in seven fucking seasons, <strong>and he’s Riker.</strong></p>

<p>Phlox meets with some Vulcans, who make it clear that they do not want to discuss the disease, Pa’nar Syndrome. Phlox is doing some lies to obfuscate why he wants the info, but they’re pretty sus. They explain that the disease only affects a small subculture of Vulcans that they do not tolerate nor condone.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Is this the AIDs episode</p>

<p>I am going to fucking scream. I am going to Morb. NO ONE WILL BE SAFE FROM MY MORBING.</p>

<p>So I’m not against an episode about HIV in theory. It’s an important topic and one that should be discussed about how terrible the AIDs epidemic was, and how mistreated people were by people who decided they knew what was right and correct. But I do not trust Enterprise, and I do not trust Berman. And I am right to. Cause this already fucking reeks.</p>

<p>Cause, first of all, you do not write an episode about how serious and debilitating the AIDs epidemic was while also having the B-plot be how horny an alien is for your fucking self insert. Second of all, Berman is notably a raging homophobe. But it’s okay because it’s not like T’Pol is gay. INSTEAD, SHE WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED AND GIVEN THE DISEASE THAT WAY.</p>

<p>NO ONE IS SAFE.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/W0eBAv8.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Pa’nar Syndrome is contracted by improper mind melds. This is also introducing a lot of lore about mind melds. You know how we’ve had four series with a bunch of mind melding, and it’s always been a normal regular thing all Vulcans can do? Forget that. It’s disgusting behavior that no Vulcan tolerates, and only a small minority can even do it.</p>

<p>The Vulcans find out T’Pol has it, and when Archer finds out, he’s pissed he wasn’t told. Dude, you do know what doctor patient confidentiality is right? Phlox straight up calls him out on it and he ignores it. Lovely. But for his credit, he does clean his shit up once he finds out what’s up. She was sexually assaulted, given this disease, and if the high command finds out they might fire her. Cause intolerance. It’s not logical, by ANY means, and you cannot use logic to argue for this kind of intolerance. GOD I hate what they did with Vulcans in this fucking show, holy SHIT they are awful.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/FyUI2Y1.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>A Vulcan sneaks some research to T’Pol. Why? Not cause prejudice is WRONG, of course. It’s cause he’s actually part of the minority. Of course. It’s only bad when you’re affected by it.</p>

<p>I really can’t stress how fucking awful the Vulcans are with this, they are so poorly written with no care for logic or consistancy. We need to start a temporal cold war, go back in time, and remove Rick Berman from power.</p>

<p>You may notice I’ve not been talking about the B-plot at all. That’s cause its bad. Trip is of course a fucking prejudiced idiot who doesn’t understand other cultures and is like “YOU CAN ONLY DATE ONE PERSON THAT’S WEIRD” and he refuses to talk with Phlox until WAY too late in the episode cause he’s a fucking idiot who refuses to talk to his friends or understand other cultures.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ldzddLn.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>When he DOES talk to Phlox about it, finally, he’s like “I was told to never fuck another man’s wife and I can’t change that”. Of course, it’s all about the MAN in this. The woman doesn’t matter at all, it’s all about the other man. Phlox LITERALLY says “Your loss”, which is funny. Fucking conservative southern man hangups.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/mRVlfs7.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Neli made this image which is good.</p>

<p>They get a hearing about the ethics of her being fired over this. T’Pol refuses to mention that she got it via rape, because she doesn’t want to contribute to stigmas against the minority that can do this. That’s fair.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/I6le36f.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The only good scene in this entire episode is the one where Archer straight up says “WOW you all are bigoted, what the fuck is wrong with you”. He doesn’t call them out about how illogical it is, but of course it is. T’Pol is going to be fired anyway, but then the one gay vulcan on the council, the one who snuck info to her earlier, comes out and defends her. The others IMMEDIATELY turn on him, and then he lets slip that she was raped, even though she made him promise not to. So yeah, throwing gay people under the bus is bad, but a gay person can throw himself and his people under the bus, that’s fine. He’s fired, of course, but T’Pol is protected from being fired. The end.</p>

<p>Holy fucking shit I hated this so god damn much. 44 MILLION PEOPLE DID NOT FUCKING DIE FOR THIS.</p>

<p><strong>Cease Fire</strong> - ENT
9/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/t5qRtFA.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Oh thank GOD, Shran is here. The Andorians are fighting the Vulcans, and taking very heavy casualties. But the Vulcans say they want a cease fire. The Andorians, of course, do not trust them, because Vulcans are well known for being awful. But he has an idea. Someone who can be a good mediator. A Pink Skin, as he calls them. Which feels like a slur.</p>

<p>Archer gets the call. He thinks the Vulcans want him as the ambassador, and he IS basically the closest Earth has to an ambassador, which is weird. When he gets there, the Vulcan ambassador hates that he’s there, cause he’s fucking horrible. And he demands Archer take a spy down so that they can make the treaty go in Vulcan’s favor. Archer of course refuses to do that, and takes T’Pol instead.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/2BtDgsW.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Hey look, it’s Suzie Plakson, the actor who played K’Ehleyr, the hottest woman in space.</p>

<p>So what’s the problem here? Well, years ago, Andorians came and started to terraform this D-class planet, smaller than Earth’s moon. It has dangerous radiation and is a shitty awful rock. But the Vulcans saw them moving closer to their territory, and decided to claim it as well, for defensive purposes, and annexed it during a war years ago. So they’re obviously in the wrong, right? This is obviously Vulcan aggression.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/3v7l3Tg.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The Andorians are testy and annoyed. They don’t trust Archer much, except for Shran, who is pretty okay with Archer by this point. Shran, for what its worth, is VERY willing to talk and try and work things out. His second in command is very aggressive, but he shuts her down. All he wants is the planet back, which they annexed in a war long ago. Archer agrees to try and get Ambassador Soval, the shithead he is, to come down and talk directly, not someone who can deflect and say “I’ll go to my superiors”. So he gets Soval to come down, and they’re shot down, not clear by who. It was almost certainly the Vulcans. Either that or the aggressive second in command.</p>

<p>Shran, for what its worth, thinks its his second in command. But he still gives her direct orders to go and recover them and keep them safe. Yeah, alright man.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Andorians have some reinforcements arriving in a ship. The Vulcans and Andorians move towards each other to fight… when Trip makes an order. Move the Enterprise between them. Holy shit, a <strong>good Trip moment??</strong> He goes “I will fire upon ANYONE who make an aggressive move. Let’s not start a war today, folks.”</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/HGTaQpY.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Okay, yeah, it was the second in command. A shame. Shran gets there, sees that Archer is fighting her, and after some talking, thankfully believes Archer and has her arrested. She’s like “There are many others who feel the way I do. We need to kill the Vulcans for what they’ve done”. Shran says he intends to make a stand, and prove himself as honorable. No more killing.</p>

<p>Shran has some VERY good lines. Archer: “I believe I’ve heard that compromises are what happens when both parties are disassisfied.” Shran: “Then these talks have been EXTREMELY successful. Welp, drink with me, to our mutual disatisfaction.”</p>

<p>This was just straight up a good episode. More of this please.</p>

<p><strong>Future Tense</strong> - ENT
6/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/81z02up.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Enterprise finds a random damaged ship out in the middle of nowhere. A stealth ship that bounces all scans, no engine, a fused hatch, and a dead human inside. Perhaps Zefram Cochrane, who canonically disappeared and reappeared in TOS? No obviously not, we know that. But who? Weirder still, the ship appears… bigger on the inside than the outside.</p>

<p>Holy SHIT, it’s a Dr. Who crossover.</p>

<p>While Trip and Reed are deep in temporal nonsense, the Suliban show up. Oh god dammit, it’s a temporal cold war episode. The Suliban demand the ship, Archer says “nah”, and they fight. But somehow some Suliban sneak on board and try to vent the launch bay, even while Trip and Reed are in there. But they manage to shake them off, for now.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Phlox finds out our dead friend is human, yes…. but part Vulcan. And also a few other things. MANY generations of interspecies breeding. Humans gonna fuck aliens, thats just what we do.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ChSjmnA.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They look at some of the Future Notes they still have from whats his face, and find out its a future ship. Meanwhile, Archer and T’Pol are super hung up on the idea of Humans and Vulcans breeding, because of y’know, the sexual tension.</p>

<p>Anyways another ship shows up. It’s a ship that’s not immediately recognizable… but T’Pol knows what it is. A Tholian ship. Holy SHIT, the Tholians??? Been excited to see them! I know that Enterprise has some Tholians, and a Gorn, and I’ve been wanting that for ages. I doubt it’ll be as exciting as it is in my mind. The Tholian communicates with squeaks and squeals, and then a robot voice. It’s very Orz-y. It’s like “Archer, we are here to retrieve the vessel. It is dangerous for you.” and then when Archer says no, they try and tractor Enterprise, but fuck off unhappily when Archer threatens to destroy the ship. Archer is making NO friends today.</p>

<p>Good weird star trek moment where Reed and Trip are doing work on the ship, and then the scene keeps happening over and over, as soon as they open the hatch. They eventually realize it, and it’s kinda funny. At first I was like “Weird glitch in the video- oh”. The ship is releasing some unknown radiation, like the Tholians said. Whoops! Might be dangerous. T’Pol wants that ship gone, or destroyed. Archer wants to keep it so they can take a more active part in this temporal cold war. T’Pol says that is a very, very bad idea. I agree. That means we’d get more Temporal Cold War episodes.</p>

<p>They’re chased by some Suliban, but thankfully a Vulcan cruiser is nearby to help. They flee to them, injured and limping, aaaand the ship is damaged. By the Tholians. Uh oh. The Tholians make quick work of the Suliban, and Archer plans a surprise for them. He and Reed set up a fucking nuke inside the ship, though time keeps resetting so they have to get faster and faster at setting up this nuke. They send it out, aaaaand the warhead has been neutralized. So much for THAT plan. Then, all things related to the ship disappear, and the Tholians just dip.</p>

<p>The episode kinda just fizzles and ends, but not before Archer makes one more comment about Vulcans and Humans fucking. You just can’t get off this, can you man?</p>

<p>This was fine, I just don’t care about temporal cold war shit, or T’parcher, or whatever the ship is called. Archol?</p>

<p><strong>Canamar</strong> - ENT
5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/gCyELLG.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The shuttle Archer and Trip (of course its more Trip) were using is found floating dead in space. Turns out they were abducted. Some aliens assumed Archer and Trip were smuggling and are sending them to Canamar, a notorious penal colony. The guards keep shocking them whenever they want cause they’re cops. The criminals aren’t much better.</p>

<p>Enterprise finds them, and gets them released. Unfortuantely, this happens RIGHT before a prison riot and the criminals take over the ship. Suddenly, its Con Air. Archer plays this new prison riot well, basically taking the role of “Yeah I was a smuggler all along”. The lead criminal here is a guy named Kuroda Lor-ehn. He used to be at this jail, Canamar, which they were all being taken to. He is not going back. Ever. He is NEVER going back.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/1vVQ27r.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Some ships find the transport vessel and try to take them out, but with Trips help, they manage to escape. Obviously, Archer and Trip are NOT happy they’re doing this, and when Kuroda orders Archer, at gun point, to blow up the enemy ships, he refuses. He’s only wanted for smuggling, not murder.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/X4sSSkq.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Archer gets on Kuroda’s good side. He offers to work with Trip and Archer, and tells his story. He was arrested even though he was innocent and thrown in a shitty jail for 5 years. That started him on his path to darkness. I wonder what this episode thinks about the jailing system. The answer is, not much. I don’t think they thought very hard abotu the politics of this at all.</p>

<p>Kuroda doesn’t plan to release any of the other prisoners. He’ll have the ship incinerated, while they get out scot free. Wow, what a dick. So now Archer has even MORE lives that he has to save. They just keep piling em up on this guy. Time to try and take the ship. Trip has the Nausicaan, Archer has the grizzled veteran murderer. Evenly matched, for sure. Obviously it doesn’t work, but the next attempt works, with Enterprise people bursting in to save everyone, just as the shuttle’s orbit starts to decay and kill everyone. Kuroda has one last Trekian fight with Archer. WHY is he? He could just go with them? Because this makes it easier to leave him to die in the ship, of course. Archer wins by using the tools of the oppressors to defeat him, and then Kuroda dies, rather dying than going back to prison.</p>

<p>Archer yells at the ambassador and tells him to fuck off, and he sits there sulking like “but our arrest first ask questions later policy always works ):”</p>

<p>This was… functional.</p>

<p><strong>The Crossing</strong> - ENT
2/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/zySz1G9.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Enterprise is unceremoneously eaten by a giant whale-shark ship. It’s very blue. They send a shuttle pod out to try and explode the inside of the ship. Inside are these weird floating ghost thingies. One of them possesses Trip for a few seconds, weirding everyone out. They take him back, and it SEEMS fine, but soon he’s acting very strangely. Getting confused, acting like others are his superior officer, wandering off.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/gCUaAYV.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They find Tucker, who’s eating, and is like “Y’all gotta TRY this, have you?” “Uh, it’s called bread.” Turns out he’s been fully taken over by the wisps outside, which he is fine with being called. He says Tucker will be back, he just wanted to experience this. Archer is very, VERY aggressive about this. “I want my crewman back and I want my ship released!” I mean, dude, this is a first contact situation, and the wisps are NOT aggresive, they went “He’s having a good time and we just wanted to experience what it was like to have bodies”. But Archer is like “FUCK YOU GIVE ME MY CREWMAN”.</p>

<p>The worst part is he’ll be proven right by the end of this episode. And the moral of the story will be that it’s right to be xenophobic and not trust other cultures.</p>

<p>This series is the worst, and I think it can all be pointed to the politics of its era. 9/11 era USA. It’s dangerous. Archer is like “Maybe T’Pol is right and I’m being xenophobic because they’re so different”, literally a few episodes after he claimed that Humanity left bigotry behind long ago. But again, he’s proven right.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/t1qXfgM.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>More wisps move in and are less…. cooperative than the first. He’s also like “You should join the crossing with us and try to be male”. T’Pol is like “I’ve never thought about it”, because being trans doesn’t exist in the 22nd century. As more people are taken over, they need to find out who’s themselves and who’s not. So now its The Thing, but we know Phlox can’t be taken, he’s apparently incompatable. They find a way to scan for taken crewmen, and also find out, kinda by accident, that the Catwalk is a space they can’t get into, due to its plating.</p>

<p>T’Pol believes she can resist the wisps, and goes out of the Catwalk to try and stop them. They immediately try to take her, but she DOES resist. This also means she can read them, and knows their plan. Okay, why can’t Tucker… whatever. So, their ship is dying, and they need to move to hosts. They can’t just live in space. But uh, they’re not in the ship anymore?? They have to move from the ship to the vacuum of space. And apparently being in a corpse is the same as being in the vacuum of space. Hmm. I think this is dumb and poorly written.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/WEXufYp.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>At least this episode gives Phlox more to do, cause he’s the only one who can easily wander through the ship. Anyways it turns out that Tucker has actually been taken, and is now aware of their plan and is going to stop them. They have scanners that tell them if someone’s taken? What the fuck?</p>

<p>Tucker goes to fight Phlox, and it’s cool to see Phlox fight. He releases a gas which will apparently knock the wisps out of him. He succeeds and knocks the wisps out of everyone, who go to… space. This episode is dumb. They try to leave, but the ship persues them, ready to eat them again. So they blow the ship up, killing every single one of the alien wisps.</p>

<p>SUCCESSFUL FIRST CONTACT. But it’s okay, they were The Other, and were violent and trying to take over the ship.</p>

<p>This episode was fine from like, a watching sense, but its theming legit disgusts me, and I can’t read it as anything else. Star Trek is a political show that represents things. It’s not just a monster show with evil things that want to kill people. There are reasons, and in TNG, they would have found a way to communicate with the aliens and help fix their ship, or there would have been internal wisp conflict where they work with THEM. Not in this episode! They’re just all evil! We can kill them though and not think about it, because everyone who comes into conflict with us is an enemy that we can just forget is sapient!</p>

<p>Fuck this shit. I am really disliking Enterprise, a lot.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="Enterprise" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">LizstarTrek - Enterprise Season 2 episodes 9 - 14</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/lizstartrek/2025/11/02/LizstartrekEnt2-3.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="LizstarTrek - Enterprise Season 2 episodes 9 - 14" /><published>2025-11-02T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-11-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/lizstartrek/2025/11/02/LizstartrekEnt2-3</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/lizstartrek/2025/11/02/LizstartrekEnt2-3.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/arpI9Yz.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p>IT’S BEEN A LOOOOONG ROOOOOAAAD</p>

<p><strong>Singularity</strong> - ENT
5.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/00vlP5K.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Interesting cold open here where we get T’Pol’s log as she crew is all passed out throughout the ship. She says they’re still moving, but might be debris by the time they get to their destination. Cool, good setup so far. And then we get the flashback to figure out what’s going on. Ah, in media res.</p>

<p>Enterprise is heading to a trinary system that has a black hole as a part of the system, which is weird. Also Archer makes Trip look at his chair, it’s very uncomfortable. I wish the entire episode was about his shittyh chair. Everyone takes turns sitting in the chair and getting knocked out like we saw in the intro. Also Chef is sick. I like Chef as a character, he’s very Morn-Coded. We NEVER see him (except for one time apparently, which my chat is upset about), but he’s fun.</p>

<p>Archer has to write a paper about his dad. He tries to make T’Pol do it for him. Do your fucking homework, Archer. Trip is an asshole about the captain’s chair, and Reed is developing Red Alert (He’s calling it Reed Alert, so they’re going to end up Han Soloing it, which is very dumb, because Red Alert is an actual Naval thing). Hoshi makes Oden while Chef is sick and everyone is a dick and kinda racist about it. How does THIS move into the intro??</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ZTvrw0s.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Everyone is suddenly getting kinda ornery and grumpy for no reason. It’s all very unsettling… except Trip, because he’s really no more shitty and unpleasant than usual. He’s ALWAYS yelling about shit that doesn’t matter. Anyways this is all just uncomfy until Reed starts packing and becoming suspicious of everything. He basically says “I’mma coup the ship” Oh God, he’s turning into a Romulan, according to that stupid fucking SNW episode. Anyways this’d work better as a Naked Time style episode if this wasn’t how they all usually were. They’re all incompetent and focusing on the wrong things anyway.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/5iLb5fd.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Only one person seems actually immune to this. And that’s T’Pol. This episode is not beating the allegations that the entirety of the ship are babies that T’Pol is babysitting. Even Phlox is out of sorts, wanting to do brain surgery on poor Mayweather really REALLY bad. T’Pol ends up knocking him out to protect Mayweather, but the scans of Mayweather’s brain shows Shit’s Bad anyway. People start collapsing. Turns out there’s radiation from the black hole and it’s Bad. They can’t just turn around, cause the radiation would still be there. There’s a side of the blackhole where the radiation is minor.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/KAPCKxU.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>T’Pol wakes up Archer and forces him to be awake by shoving him in a shower and forcing him to drink coffee, which is kinda funny. He begrudgingly accepts helping her fly the ship through a debris field. They make it through and thankfully the radiation immediately wears off with zero lasting affects. Gee how lucky.</p>

<p><strong>Vanishing Point</strong> - ENT
2/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/MJU5YTu.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Hoshi and Trip are on a planet exploring some ruins, taking pics and studying the language. Why the FUCK is Trip down there??????? Anyways a storm comes in and they decide they HAVE to go back up NOW even though they’re in a ruin, and it’d probably be fine. Anyways they use the teleporter. Holy shit, THEY REMEMBERED THE TELEPORTER EXISTS??? Hoshi is afraid of using the teleporter cause She’s Girl.</p>

<p>Hoshi is still uncomfy after her teleport, and the others tell her a Ghost Story about the first guy who died in a transporter incident. To be FAIR, Hoshi pushed them to tell her it, they didn’t want to. She’s VERY unhappy after the teleporter incident. She KNOWS something is wrong with her… molecules.</p>

<p>So, I suffer from hypochondria a lot. I get it. I don’t think they’re doing this WRONG really, and the transporter is a fucking thing. You wouldn’t catch me DEAD on that thing, hell no. I’ll take a shuttle, we have faster than light travel, why the hell do we need transporters.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/NXjN0nO.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Berman has such a fucking fascination with making Hoshi take her fucking shirt off, the fucking pervert. At least she isn’t relegated to the kitchen in this episode.</p>

<p>Hoshi feels like she’s being ignored. Her alarm also doesn’t go off and she oversleeps, which is weird. Everyone doesn’t notice her at first and she’s becoming kind of paranoid. People are kinda treating her like shit. Also apparently there were aliens on the surface who are holding hostages, and Hoshi can’t translate their language. She’s dismissed, and then her replacement translates it no problem. It’s a Hoshi Must Suffer episode. Is that a thing? At least Phlox isn’t ignoreing her. Though he does kind of ignore her worries.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Z5MSLWn.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>After a talk with Trip, she seems to fade out of reality entirely. She gets stuck in the exercise room, her hand is moving through the door controls. Why doesn’t she go through the door? Or the floor??? Anyways this is a repeat of the Ro and Geordi episode from TNG. We just keep redoing ideas but worse, don’t we? That one was enjoyable because Roe and Geordi were working together so they bounced off each other, AND they could actually do something to try and fix things. Hoshi doens’t have that expertise. Watching Hoshi be sad and ignored is not very pleasant to watch. ESPECIALLY with Trip VICTIM BLAMING HER? “Why didn’t I force you to go first? Why didn’t you LISTEN TO ME?” Then Archer calls her dad and he’s VERY slow on the uptake and real shitty. What the fuck is this episode</p>

<p>Anyways Hoshi finds some aliens on the ship planting bombs. She finds a way to make a light flicker and send an SOS, which Archer sees, accepts is an SOS, then ignored anyway, cause T’Pol tells him to ignore it. The ONE THING Hoshi can do, and it’s ignored. It’s FINALLY an episode where Hoshi gets to do something and it’s boring and bad.</p>

<p>In the end, Hoshi rematerializes and it turns out It Was All A Dream. She just had to be kept in the pattern buffer for 8.3 seconds. The end.</p>

<p>This episode can bite me.</p>

<p><strong>Precious Cargo</strong> - ENT
2/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/RoMPUd7.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The Enterprise gets a distress call from a ship. They’re having some issues and need Trip’s help, fair enough. They’re transporting some girl in cryo freeze. Trip takes one look at her and falls in love cause of fucking course he does. Fucking Trip.</p>

<p>Anyways he accidentally wakes her, because of course he does, and she yells at him and tries to escape. One of the two alien dudes on the ship goes back after he gets an alarm (they were having dinner with the captain), knocks Trip out, and flies away, leaving his friend behind. lol whoops.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/BrM2VHe.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The frozen princess is, in fact, a princess. She claims she was kidnapped to be held for ransom. She has spots all the way down :o She’s a spoiled brat who is like “I’m too valuable to hurt, so I don’t try escaping, they’ll just pay my ransom and it’ll be fine”. She’s a shitty brat, but decides to go with Tucker anyway as he tries escaping through the escape pod. This turns the episode into Resident Evil 4 but Ashley is Unlikable. And so is Leon. Resident Evil 4 but Unlikable and Without Any Cool Zombies. Or maybe What if Spaceballs Sucked? They don’t get along at first, but after a while Tucker realizes she’s lonely and she realizes he’s rough but has a soft interior and uuhhhblhlblbl.</p>

<p>WAY more interesting is what Enterprise does to the guy they still have. They pretend he’s going to be executed if he doesn’t tell them where his partner went.</p>

<p>WHY DOES TRIP HAVE TO MENTION HE’S FROM FLORIDA EVERY 5 FUCKING MINUTES? NO OTHER TREK CHARACTER HAS DONE THIS. I GUESS maybe Worf but like, I hated it when he did it too. We fucking GET IT TRIP, You’re FROM FLORIDA. You’re a fucking Southern Boy. As a Southern Girl, shut up, it sucks shit down here.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/9KFUzoX.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They get into an argument and then fight and then make out and fuck, because that’s what it says to do in the hack’s guide to story writing. Then the alien captor finds them and Trip and him fight in the swamp. And then THEY kiss. No, not really, but that would have made this episode way more interesting. Enterprise comes and picks them up, the end. The princess is like “Come visit and we’ll fuck like rabbits” and then it ends. This was Rick Berman’s weird fucking fanfic for his stupid fucking self insert and I am unhappy I had to watch it.</p>

<p>This is literally the exact same plot as The Perfect Mate from TNG. It’s even the same race. But so much worse. Why do we keep just stealing previous episodes but poorly? This KEEPS HAPPENING.</p>

<p><strong>Catwalk</strong> - ENT
8/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/oyhkKTB.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This one looks like it could be good. PLEASE be good, god I need this.</p>

<p>Enterprise meets some aliens who are like “hey, we need your help, the storm will be here soon”. What storm? Well, turns out there’s a kind of storm that’s on the way, it’s VERY deadly and dangerous. And it’ll be here in four hours. They could outrun it at warp 7 but uh, oops!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/cmJ1l9S.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They have one place they can ALL fit which is properly protected. The proto-Jefferies tube, the “Catwalk”, the spot in the middle of the Nacelle. It’ll be cramped but they can prolly live in there for the time it takes. Which is, uh, 8 days. Oh boy.</p>

<p>AND the randos they invited in seem Kinda Sus and are keeping to themselves in a little tent they have set up.</p>

<p>I’m starting to get real tired of Reed. He’s either boring and like, a non-presence, or EXTREMELY annoying. Honestly? Maybe more than Trip. Trip is always grumpy and obstinant, but at like a 6/10. Reed is sometimes a 2/10, then he jumps to 11/10 ANY time something even SLIGHTLY goes wrong. Pissing and moaning cause there’s no shower, claiming Trip’s team is incompetent idiots cause of that. Trip is like “Dude, I had 4 hours, you’re lucky we have a toilet”.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/PL8GzEG.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Holy shit, it’s Chef! Just off screen, but he’s here!!</p>

<p>Trip goes down to check some stuff out, in a space suit, where he finds a bunch of people just walking around on the ship, no suits. They’re Takarets, just like the aliens they invited onto their ship. Archer asks them wtf is going on, and although their leader refuses to admit whats going on, the others are like “Fuck that they have a right to know”. They’re desserters of the Takaret Militia, a thuggish military who are frankly evil. And that militia is now trying to take over the ship, cause why not? Also cause they think the desserters are on there somewhere.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/66zpQgz.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Archer and T’Pol go to try and sneak control to the others. Archer sends him a message: “You’re in my chair”. A CLASSIC Trek captain line, like that line. He tells him very clearly “I will blow up my own ship if you don’t fuck off”, all the while they’re trying to turn off the thrusters (the people in them are currently cooking) and direct the ship into an eddy that’ll rip it apart.</p>

<p>The militia is like “oh shit fuck this” and run away. The bluff works, and Enterprise is safe.</p>

<p>That was just a good episode. Nice to have character moments and some fun stakes.</p>

<p><strong>Dawn</strong> - ENT
3.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/arpI9Yz.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>While looking at a gas giant (“Wow, this gas giant has dozens of moons” says Trip, not knowing what a gas giant is, I guess), Trip is attacked by a random ship and he crashes on a nearby planet. This happens to Trip a lot. This is like, the third time Trip has been stuck somewhere with a broken shuttle? He tries to get settled and get stuff fixed, but then he’s attacked by an alien and barely escapes.</p>

<p>Archer is contacted by the aliens, who explain that they’re the Arkonians, and this is their territory, leave. But also, they lost contact with THEIR shuttle. Archer suggests they work together to find their shuttles and then they’ll happily leave.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/RA81mbo.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This alien is a little animalistic gremlin. He steals the transciever, Trip tries to get it back, and is shot and stunned. Good job, Trip. The Arkonian holds him at gunpoint to try and force him to fix it, and it just goes back and forth like that. They can’t communicate, Trip doesn’t have his communicator for some reason. Maybe Reed left it on a planet somewhere. Reed and him kinda try to communicate but they’re very antagonistic? And any attempts to develop trust are bombed when Trip starts the fighting again. Enemy Mine this is not. Darmok this is not.</p>

<p>It keeps hinting that MAYBE they’d work together, but then they’re at each other’s throats. Over and over. This happens like three times. It is not good. They EVENTUALLY stop beating the shit out of each other, not because of any actual communication or desire to work together, but because the sun is rising and it’s getting hot and they’re suffering. This also unfortunately makes Trip take his fucking shirt off, so now I’M suffering too. Enterprise contacts them, but Trip refuses to leave without him. For some reason. But eventually they are rescued. The Arkonian leader is like “Thanks for rescuing my crewman. I hope your’s is okay, and if he was fired upon without provocation, he will be disciplined. But the alien is, at least, grateful he didn’t kill Trip, even when he meant to. I guess that’s the best we’ll get.</p>

<p>Got a little better at the end but still bad. Tonight was literally just better ideas from earlier shows regurgitated into bluh. Why do we keep doing this. Do we have NO good ideas?? Neli thinks this is one of the worst ever, because it’s very anti-Trek. Almost anti-communication as a concept, it’s saying communication can’t work. I don’t think it’s intentionally saying that, I just think this show was very poorly written in a very xenophobic time.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="Enterprise" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry></feed>
