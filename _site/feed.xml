<p>So way back in the 90s, as computers and consoles were getting better with Chess AI, there was a game called Battle Chess. It was basically just Chess, but any time a piece was taken, there was a little animation between the pieces where they fought. It was a cute little thing, though its pacing was a little off. Sometimes you just wanna play Chess, honestly, and watching a little animation with EVERY piece being taken takes a lot of time.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/FCZPyg9.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>But it was still a popular idea, so they took that and brought it to Star Wars! Star Wars was always really, really big, and it sure was in the early 90s. Enter Star Wars Chess, or “The Software Toolworks Star Wars Chess” which rolls right off the fuckin’ tongue. It’s literally just what I said earlier.</p>

<p>You’ve got some fun animations here. My favorite is Yoda, the light side rook, being killed by Boba Fett, the dark side bishops, because boba fett melts Yoda and Yoda kinda becomes one of those green blobs Calvin would eat in Calvin and Hobbes. But yeah, it’s chess other than that. And I DO like chess. The AI here is fine. Can only think a few moves ahead, not too hard to beat, even on the hardest difficulties. Don’t got much more to say than that. If you ever wanted to watch Chewie get brutally murdered, this is the game for you!</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Sega CD" /><category term="Retro Games" /><category term="Chess" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">LizstarTrek - Enterprise Season 1 episodes 1 - 5</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/lizstartrek/2025/09/07/LizstartrekEnt1-1.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="LizstarTrek - Enterprise Season 1 episodes 1 - 5" /><published>2025-09-07T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-09-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/lizstartrek/2025/09/07/LizstartrekEnt1-1</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/lizstartrek/2025/09/07/LizstartrekEnt1-1.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/LleEO6i.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p>STARTING ENTERPRISE NOW! I know NOTHING about this, other than it takes place very early in the timeline, has a guy named ARcher and a guy named Phlox, people smother gel on each other naked a lot, and a lot of people get a lot of opinions.</p>

<p><strong>Broken Bow</strong> - ENT
6/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/vgoPgE9.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We start with a kid being racist towards Vulcans, complaining that if the Vulcans were actually helping them, they’d be going at Warp 5 by now. We then jump cut 30 years later, and it’s now the opening of Star Trek. Some aliens drop down, a Klingon blows them up, and then a farmer blows him away with a blaster shotgun.</p>

<p>Then we get the opening theme song. If you were wondering, this is was my watch club’s reaction to it:</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/6ZMdhOd.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>So apparently the plan for Enterprise was that Voyager’s rating were falling by the end, so they’re trying to make a new kind of Star Trek. Something Modern. By modern, we mean dated as fuck, and kind of boring, I guess? Also the CGI is very, VERY dated too.</p>

<p>Anyways, the Vulcans are here. The Klingons are upset a Klingon got shot. He’s still alive, but the Vulcans are ready to just kill him. Their logic is nonsense. Then we’re introducd to our ‘hero’.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/c9gbUUj.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Captain Archer’s ship is ready to be launched, but the Vulcans are like “Don’t launch yet and go out and meet other people in space, you’re not ready”. They’re all kind of dicks about it. Whoever wrote this doesn’t know how to write Vulcans. A Vulcan woman tries telling him to wait until he’s ready, and he threatens to beat her. Captain “Would beat a woman” Archer. The Earth Admiral is like “alright fuck these guys, we’re launching after all”.</p>

<p>We then get scenes of all the crew. It’s kinda hard to tell who is and is not important in these scnees, but I’ll try and explain them all. We’ve got Archer, he’s kinda smug and I’m not sure how much I like him so far. Then Phlox, the doctor working on the Klingon who seems like a friendly guy, Reed, the Armory Officer. I can’t tell what his deal is. Mayweather, the resident Black Guy. We’ll see how he is. So far he seems young and friendly. He’s also really horny for aliens. Sato, a Linguist who’s really excited to learn Klingon, she’s kinda cool so far, but she has a character trait of being anxious about being on spaceships and it’s slightly annoying. “Trip” Tucker, the Engineer, who’s kinda belligerent and rude. He yells a lot. I cannot tell Tucker or Reed apart.</p>

<p>And then we meet T’Pol.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/0rhsVB0.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>She’s assigned to the ship, the Enterprise, by their Vulcan superiors. No one is happy about this. When she entered in, I was like “is Archer gonna be racist in this?” and then he opened his fucking mouth, and yes, he is. AND Sexist! I think the idea is that he’s annoyed at the Vulcans cause of history and personal things, and the idea is that we’ll eventually grow as people and our cultures and civilizations will grow closer. That’s the idea. But it’s not pleasant to watch the start of that!!</p>

<p>We also get a scene where an alien talks to the Emperor from Star Wars about the Klingon being takne by the Humans. This guy’s alien species then comes and steals the Klingon away. The alien’s species is the… Suliban. Which is inspired by the Taliban. Yeah. <em>sigh</em>. The Suliban is genetically enhanced, which is strange for their species. T’Pol tries to tell them to go back home. She’s told to shut up. They go to the last known place the Klingon, Klaang, was known to be. A planet called Rigel. Everyone is pretty much immediately kidnapped. T’Pol gives a “told you so” look. Alright.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ia1Bkar.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We learn that this girl, Sarin, was who Klaang met before hand. She kisses Archer because apparently though kisses she can gauge how truthful someone is being. It feels like Berman was just horny, and also thought kisses would sell more. It’s dumb. She agrees to help them, then gets killed and tells them to find Klaang. Okay, sure. She tells them about The Cabal, and something called The Temporal Cold war. Whatever that is. On the escape, Archer is shot in the leg and T’Pol decides to take command of the Enterprise. Dude, he just got shot in the leg, it’s fine.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/r4V61Td.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We then get the most infamous thing in Enterprise, at least to me. T’Pol and Trip get into the decontamination room and rub gell on each other. It’s extremely over sexual and the smell of Berman is thick all over it, and I hate it. They exposit over this sexualization, or sexposit I guess, and T’Pol ends up actually not taking advantage of this situation to make them go back to Earth, but instead do what Archer would have wanted and go after the aliens. It’s a VERY sudden turn around, there was no… anything there. Maybe that’s just what sex gel does to a woman.</p>

<p>They’re attacked by the aliens but are hiding from them. They steal one of their ships, and go down in it, Trip and Archer. Why is he bringing the chief engineer for this mission? Instead of the guy who can actually fly the ship, Merriweather? I dunno. They enter the alien vessel and rescue Klaang, but leave Archer behind. I have no idea why they left Archer behind. So the story can happen? I dunno, it makes no sense to me. Archer tells Tucker tells Trip not to come back for him, but then lies and is like “How DARE you all not go back for him! IT’S AN ORDER OF HIS!” and I think Trip is supposed to be the good guy in this situation.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/6LFsTXX.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Archer talks to The Bad Guy, some dude named Silik, and they fight in a temporal anomoly room, and then in a flashing room. It’s… a little rough.</p>

<p>He’s teleported out just as before he was about to be shot at. The telporter btw is only used for like, supplies and food. It’s SUPPOSED to be safe for Humans but this was the first test of THAT. Yay!</p>

<p>We take Klaang to the Klingons, and find out that apparently Klaang was carrying some data in his DNA. Oh boy. This is technically Klingon First Contact, and it seems to go… kinda well.</p>

<p>Archer then openly admits he’s been a racist and is looking to move past that, and wants T’Pol to stay on board. She offers to contact High Command and ask them herself. Again, the pacing of this character development feels slightly off but it’s not a bad payoff.</p>

<p>Over all, the episode is fine. It’s fine for setting up over arching plot. But as for the character setup, I dunno. I have NO clue what Reed’s deal is, he has no personality so far except he’s English, and there.</p>

<p><strong>Broken Bow</strong> - ENT
7/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/EWAxYTt.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Hoshi Sato starts our episode off by being sad her pet slug they found on an alien planet is dying. Oh this’ll be good. They apparently haven’t had very much luck meeting aliens out here yet.</p>

<p>Reed is grumpy that they left stardock without testing their weapons, which is the closest we’ve gotten to a character trait for him. The tests go poorly. A lot of this early episode is just… people talking about how nothing is happening, and very little happening. Though we do get to see more Phlox. He’s fun. He’s also VERY horny. He and T’Pol are the only two non-Humans on this ship, and he’s here cause he wants to learn as much as he can about other Cultures and peoples. Even, and possibly especially, their mating habits.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/dpvnXDZ.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>THey find a spaceship floating around out in space, and venting air. It seems to be damaged. They decide to try and find out what’s wrong, going over to it. Trip is pissy and like “I should go on the mission with you! I came here to explore, not sit in Engineering and Engineer!” Then why the fuck did you sign up to be an Engineer? Meanwhile, Hoshi is like “I don’t want to go over there sir, I’m claustrophobic”. Then <strong>why did you sign up to be on a spaceship???</strong> These people don’t seem to know what they’re doing here.</p>

<p>They find some corpses on the ship  being drained of something. T’Pol now suggests they leave. Archer is like “we should stay and find out who did this so we can stop them!” It’s an interesting argument in this case actually. And the first time T’Pol is written for giving an argument and it actually being any kind of reasonable.</p>

<p>Hoshi screamed at the corpses, and she’s talking with Phlox about it. He’s VERY chill. “It’s honestly a good thing you’re not used to rooms full of corpses?” and basically politely suggests she should take care of herself, and not be here if it’s not what she wants.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/hFXHNHM.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Archer decides fuck this and goes back to try and find out who the corpses are. Apparently the attackers are harvesting their blood, which has a special compound in it. As the aliens come back, surprise surprise, Archer blows up the harvesting pump and heads back to the Enterprise.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/09UM9sZ.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They’re tractored in by the murderers, and then another ship shows up, this one one of the murdered aliens. He thinks they did it, and is angry at them. They need Hoshi to talk to him, but she’s all in her head about it. And you know how they take her out of it? “We need you to do this”. That’s all it takes to make someone no longer self conscious and afraid. She talks to him directly, not through her translation app, and it works out and they blow up the attacking aliens. Yay, more examples of why we need more fucking translators on ships.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/UVov5Kb.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>And then while making a metaphor about Hoshi finding her place on the ship, they brought an invasive species to an alien planet. The end!</p>

<p>This one was okay too.</p>

2/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/3X4o0xS.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>But we already watched SNW this week!!</p>

<p>While flying around, they find an Earth-like M-class planet. They decide to go down and check it out, cause it seems nice. T’Pol thinks they should spend a week scanning it instead. They refuse, put on these dumb hats, and go down with an away team. They also brung the fucking dog. Archer’s DOG is on this away mission. Do they have any idea how dangerous space is?!?! Like, yes, T’Pol is kinda a bitch at this point, but when she’s like “We were scheduled to rendevous 15 minutes ago, where are you?” and they’re like “Gosh get off my ass mom, we’re just enjoying our time here”, we’re not supposed to… empathize with her??? Also why are the people sent on the survey mission the engineer and the pilot???</p>

<p>They camp out on the planet. Is that why they’re out exploring? To go camping?  These people are too lax. Merriweather tells a ghost story, which is cute. Very suddenly, there’s a storm that rolls across the planet. They hide out in a cave, and now it’s a fucking ghost story. Merriweather goes back out and sees some forces walking around outside. Oh boy.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/b4yRYtw.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Scans still show nothing. One of the redshirts they took with them freaks out and runs out into the storm. These people are not prepared to be in space. They’re not prepared to be on a HIKE, let alone in space. They choose the wrongest, dumbest things to do, and then get pissy when their babysitter (T’Pal) tries to help them in any small way.</p>

<p>One of the other redshirts sees T’Pal talking to aliens, then later when she asks her about them, T’Pal is like “…what are you talking about? I’ve seen no one else here.” The first Redshirt tells Archer to “go to hell” when Archer is like “We’re landing to take you out”. They’re struggling to land the shuttle though. Gosh, if only they had their fucking pilot up there instead of ON THE SURVEY MISSION. Archer crashes the shuttle like he’s Captain Olimar and has to fly out.</p>

<p>Trip gets all up in T’Pal’s face and is racist and assumes she’s evil and trying to hurt them. He pulsl a fucking gun on her when she’s like “Let’s go get some water”. I think they’re trying to make him a Bones kinda thing but he’s like… very, VERY aggressive and irrational and frankly, awful. I kind of hate him? I hope there’s SOMETHING on here that’s making him go nuts, but this isn’t really THAT far from what we’ve seen before.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ld0HHkV.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Our first teleporter incident! He lives, though. THis is the first redshirt who ran off and told Archer to go to hell. According to Phlox, he’s filled with a psychotropic compound. Okay, that explains it. It’s the LSD Bad Trip Planet. Archer calls Trip, tells him to stop being violent, and explains what’s going on. “You trained for this, y’all?” but the training means jack squat.</p>

<p>Trip: “Hey aliens, we’ll teach you that she lied to you about Humans! We’re actually wonderful, pleasant people!” as he waves his fucking gun around and shoots at the wall. Also there’s poison now so they need to act MUCH more quickly. But Trip is too far gone. They first try to explain it to him, but he’s too paranoid. They then trick him into letting them talk to her in Vulcan, and basically tell her “fucking shoot him”. It works.</p>

<p>It all works out in the end. I didn’t like this episode very much. It was mostly stupid and unpleasant to watch.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="Enterprise" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">LizstarTrek - Strange New Worlds Season 7 episode 6</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/lizstartrek/2025/09/07/LizstartrekSNW3-2.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="LizstarTrek - Strange New Worlds Season 7 episode 6" /><published>2025-09-07T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-09-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/lizstartrek/2025/09/07/LizstartrekSNW3-2</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/lizstartrek/2025/09/07/LizstartrekSNW3-2.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/IVV1wHl.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p>This is the third season of SNW, finally coming out. We’re gonna watch an episode of this once a week until we finish, alongside Voyager, cause it’s coming out y’know, one a week. Yay! I love SNW!</p>

<p><strong>Through the Lens of Time</strong> - SNW
5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/N8mQara.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This season is going really hard on the romance drama, which is starting to get mostly tiring for me. But it’s ALSO pushing this new nurse guy, Dana. He’s SO excited and happy to be here. This guy is SO fucking dead. He’s got the voice over and it’s really pushing him, he’s so fucked. It also seems like he was brought in secretly as a third wheel so that thigns aren’t TOO awkward between Spock and Korby as they do some kind of dig.</p>

<p>Ortegas’ brother is also here! He’s recording stuff for a documentary, it seems, and is also invited to this mission, which SEEMS to be an archaeological dig on a sacred site. He’s also getting romance vibes with Uhura. They’re really trying to hook EVERYONE up this season aren’t they? Though Pelia the Warpcore Witch also seems to be real into him. And I like that, cause it’s funny.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/p5JfYBa.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They all enter some kind of temple, after Chapel does some kind of thing to gain entry. They IMMEDIATELY find corpses and Spock is like “okay, protocol tells is we need to leave now”. Korby gets pissy and refuses, and Chapel, who’s in charge of the mission, sides with him cause he’s her girlfriend. There’s also a lot of tension cause of the whole Spock x Chapel thing. See, this is why everyone shouldn’t just fuck. Use the holodeck to fuck- wait. We already had an episode about how that’s a bad idea at this time.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ypNSSmn.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>New Kid, who’s name is Gamble, acts like a TOS red shirt and randomly touches shit. Anyways, woah, New Kid gets his fucking eyes exploded cause things are actually super dangerous in here! Looks like Spock was right, what a mother fucking shock! The native living with them sees something else, freaks the fuck out, and tries to run away, and is vaporized. But we have so many things we could learn here!!! Korby was ABSOLUTELY going to just fucking die because he wasn’t being careful enough if others didn’t die before him, frankly. Why was he SO SURE that he had to do this dig RIGHT THE FUCK NOW? “I’ve waited all my life for this!” Yeah dude, but you’re like, 33. This temple isn’t going anywhere. Put down that fucking idiot ball, right now, mister!</p>

<p>They get split up, as if it couldnt’ get any worse, and are in different rooms, but able to communicate. This now turns into a split room puzzle game escape room. Seems to be the same room but also not, seperate dimensions. They can still communicate though. Why? I dunno, bad writing?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/x4jYCCp.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The Eyeball Regenerator, which apparently exists, is not working. New Kid’s brain is also registering as braindead. New episode name: Gamble’s Brain. Gamble is also acting Kinda Sus now. Hmm.</p>

<p>Ten minutes ago, Gamble’s eyes exploded. Now, Spock is saying how Korby is not being safe enough and not taking any precautions, and then he TAKES A FUCKING VISOR OFF OF A DEAD ALIEN AND PUTS IT ON HIS EYEBALLS AND USES IT TO LOOK AT THINGS. WHAT THE FUCK, SPOCK? I’m starting to think this episode might just not be well written.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/HLyV7Ze.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Patel, who I remind you is now half Gorn, meets Gamble, and starts speaking in tongues. Gamble does the same, and they proceed to beat the shit out of each other. Gamble also murders someone in the scuffle. After he’s captured, he just breaks through the force fields and kills more red shirts. Damn, this episode has a body count.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/hp0x8tF.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Pelia shoots Gamble in the back, releasing the ancient dimensional alien inside of him. Scotty then captures it in a Pokeball and tosses it up into the transporter. He locks it in the transport buffer, until they can figure out what to do with it. There’s no WAY that’ll backfire!!!</p>

<p>Pelia has a big discussion about ancient evil, which turns out to be her mugging for the documentary. Okay, that was funny. I was like “wow that’s very on the nose- oh okay, that’s good”. I do like Pelia. As M’Benga calls Gamble’s parents to tell them about their son, the Enterprise computer screens flash alien text. Wow, I knew it’d backfire but THAT fast.</p>

<p>I think my judgement of this will depend on if and when it goes anywhere, but I feel it was poorly written. Something was off and the pacing was bad.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="Strange New Worlds" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 180</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/09/04/OOCY180.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 180" /><published>2025-09-04T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-09-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/09/04/OOCY180</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/09/04/OOCY180.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/FdKvpAg.png" alt="'" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>I apparently never moved my Link’s Awakening review over here. God, what do I say about Link’s Awakening? Well, it’s my all time favorite  Zelda game, which means it’s one of my favorite games ever. I replay it once every few years. I own like six copies for some reason. It’s utter Zelda perfection.</p>

<p>Coming out in the middle of the Gameboy’s life-cycle, it got a port to the Gameboy Color six years later. It’s pretty similar, with only a few minor changes, and is more of the same. I mastered the original last year, and put this one off cause some of the challenges annoyed me.</p>

<p>This set has a lot of missables. No hit challenges, don’t do this in this order, etc etc. I actually had to play this game through twice to do this because it glitched out. If you kill like 80 enemies in a row or something (I was trying to farm for acorns, forgetting how that worked) it will change your tunic color, and might glitch out other things. It gave me a photograph and I couldn’t get the achievement for getting that photograph later. Oops!</p>

<p>Link’s Awakening started as a remake of LTTP, but I’m so glad it became this in the end. It’s a weird, unique Zelda game. Lots of things that are just… It. And the story! Oh man. I think it’s fitting that my two favorite  Zeldas are Majora’s Mask and this, the two games with the most melancholy and sad stories.</p>

<p>I don’t think I need to go into a full deep dive of Link’s Awakening. All I need to tell you is that it’s fantastic, and this is a good version. Not DEFINITIVE. It adds an additional dungeon, which is an okay dungeon, and the photos system, which is cute.</p>

<p>If you’ve never played Link’s Awakening, I highly recommend it. It’s not too long compared to other Zelda games, but it’s a solid thing for a Gameboy title. Do yourself a favor and check it out.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Gameboy" /><category term="Retro Games" /><category term="Zelda" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 179</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/09/01/OOCY179.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 179" /><published>2025-09-01T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-09-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/09/01/OOCY179</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/09/01/OOCY179.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/UYb48Ag.png" alt="Out of context yuri, panels are from 'Keeping a Jewel' by Sachi Miyabe.

<p>I don’t usually review music. Music is one of those things that’s hard to recommend or review on the internet. When you try to share music, I find people are very likely to just turn their brains off and ignore your suggestions. I’m not sure why this is, but I think it’s cause everyone has specific musical tastes, just to them. Everyone but me, I guess. I love all kinds of music. Every genre, I can find something in it I like. But you know what I ESPECIALLY love? Mashup albums.</p>

<p>At AGDQ2025, my girlfriend asked me if I’d heard of Musical Transients before. She knows I love mashup albums. I had not, so we went back to our room and she showed it to me. Now, that was actually my Nap Time. I would sleep for like an hour or two, because I had to be awake until 5AM. But I’d put this album on, listen to a bit, and fall asleep to it. I do it all the time. That did not happen. I put it on, and it was so interesting, I listened to all of it, then researched the meanings of the songs. I did not take a nap that day, and I was STRUGGLING at 4AM.</p>

<p>Since then I’ve probably listened to the album 100 times. I’m not joking. This is one of my favorite albums of all time now. It’s art.</p>

<p>Musical Transients is made by Psynwave, a British musician and mashup artist who made another album a few years ago, Musical Tangents. Now, I do like Musical Tangents, but not as much. That doesn’t matter much, though. Musical Tangents was advertised as having no real theme or anything, it’s a collection of mashups. Good, well constructed mashups, with the idea of taking the original songs, and completing twisting their meanings and vibes. But still, no meaning. Musical Transients, the follow up album, was advertised the same way.</p>

<p>When I show people Musical Transients, which I do often, I tell them it has no theme for a few songs, before admitting, actually, there’s a VERY central theme to the album. Can you guess what it is? Most people can guess it by the end. I guessed it immediately, but I cheated.</p>

<p>IF YOU’RE INTERESTED IN THIS ALBUM, DO NOT READ AHEAD. This is both a review and a full total analysis of the ENTIRE album. This album is very, very dense with meaning, and I want to take it apart right in front of you. If you’re interested, watch the album, then come back to me. Yes, watch. The album has a lot of fun things in the video, and the video also has subtitles for the songs, which are very useful. Okay, we good? Let’s go.</p>

<p><strong>I BELIEVE IN THE GREEN PARADE</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/BdAyctj.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>The album starts with a song called “I Believe in the Green Parade”. It’s a mashup of Black Parade and Rainbow Connection. This album is the opening thesis of the album. It sets the theme and asks a question, basically. But it also feels slightly disconnected to the rest of the album to me. This album is a story of someone’s life, but this album is setting the tone, and is this person basically looking back. It was also designed around a meme post on Twitter from years ago that went “When Black Parade talks about the broken and the beaten and Kermit talks about the lovers and the dreamers, they’re talking about the same people”. It’s a funny post. Why not make a song about it?</p>

<p>After a bit of simple mashupping, where we get the banjo with the lyrics, it bursts into Black Parade’s backing track, and some muppet Show shenanigans. And then we get this.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/3k8OsSY.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/WxOEN4j.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>I want you to read these lyrics.</p>

<p>ITs time to put on makeup, it’s time to dress up right. It’s time to raise the curtain on the muppet show tonight.</p>

<p>And then I saw her face, now I’m a believer. Not a trace of doubt in my mind. I’m in love, I’m a believer, I couldn’t leave her, if I tried.</p>

<p>And I don’t really care if no one else believes.</p>

<p>So she said, what’s the problem baby? What’s the problem, I dunno, well maybe I’m in love, love, think about it, everytime I think about it, maybe I’m in love with <em>your body</em>. How much longer will it take to cure this? Just to cure it cause I can’t ignore it if it’s love, love, think about it, maybe I’m in love <em>with the shape of you</em></p>

<p>This sets up the thesis of the album. What’s this album about? Like I said, I cheated. And I mean, come on. The album is called Musical Transients and the cover is in the trans pride flag colors. This is a song about gender discovery, and being a trans woman. This song sets it up pretty well. It shows that the feelings are there, like with the first line about putting on makeup, moving into “and then I saw her face”. Then it makes it clear, “I don’t care if anyone else believes”. This will be a happy story with a happy end. Then the last line, they change the lyrics a bit. “Maybe I’m in love <em>with your body</em>” and “<em>the shape of you</em>”. Not you. Just the shape of your body. I love the feminine body. I sure do wish I had it. Can’t stop thinking about it.</p>

<p>This WILL be a story with a happy end, though it might take a bit to get there, as shown by the next few lines. Black Parade comes back in, with:</p>

<p>“On and on we carry through the fears. Disappointed faces of our peers”</p>

<p>“Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road”, cue the rest of Time of Your Life. Followed immediately by…</p>

<p>“This is my fight! Take back my life! Prove I’m alright!”</p>

<p>Being trans in this world is a dangerous thing. Literally dangerous in many cases. Outsiders will judge and hate you for the rest of your life. It’s a turning point, do we ignore this call, or do we go through with it? The song makes it quite clear: This is YOUR life. Take it back. Don’t let others control what and who you are, through their personal fears and delusions. Be who you want to be.</p>

<p>It ends with one more “I don’t relaly care if nobody else believes in me”, with a fade out of the Rainbow Connection. It’s an uplifting song, and a good thesis statement to the entire album.</p>

<p><strong>I WANNA BE A ROCK</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/tnn0g3m.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>The rest of the album is a story. Its the story of our narrator as they go through their life. It starts with them, as a young boy. This song is a combination of a lot of hard scrabbled masculine songs, rip snortin’ masculine songs. We’ve got We Will Rock You, with the Ramones Blitzkrieg Bop, and then Kenny Loggins comes in with Danger Zone, and finally Nickelback’s Rockstar. A lot of masculine manly man songs. But when Nickelback’s Rockstar gets to the chorus, it’s not “I wanna be a Rockstar”, it comically cuts off with “I wanna be a rock”, as the other character in the song goes “….what??”</p>

<p>I think this song has multiple interpretations. I’ve heard someone say that wanting to be a rock is gender identity, a gender neutral “I don’t wanna be a man like you all think I should be, I’ll be gender neutral, like this rock”, but I don’t think so. I think rocks are manly. That’s a weird thing to say, but like, it’s tough and course, LIKE A MAN. It’s stupid, and intentionally so, IMO. It’s a joke. It’s one big giant joke about masculinity and toxic masculinity.</p>

<p>There’s also one other thing. Rockstar’s lyrics are SLIGHTLY changed elsewhere too. The original lyric is “I’m gonna cut my hair and change my name”. It’s now “I’m gonna <em>grow</em> my hair and change my name”. Ha ha, wouldn’t it be REALLY funny if I grew my hair out? Like, as a joke? This is a very real early gender thing, to me.</p>

<p>Anyways this continues for a while until…</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/D7V00GW.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>These manly man songs are interrupted by t.A.T.u.’s All The Things She Said. Which is maybe one of the most feminine centric songs I can think of. And even when the masculine songs begin to break back in, with the drum line, and then lyrics, t.A.T.u. is still there, in the background. It won’t go away, ever again. It keeps breaking through, always reminding you of that inkling at the back of your brain. And even now, the lyrics to the other songs are changed slightly.</p>

<p>“I wanna be a-“ with static, and a face behind the static. That don’t look like a rock. Or even a man’s face. Hmm, what could that be?</p>

<p><strong>LIVE LAUGH LOVE</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/z4nA3K7.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>This song starts with one of the best parts on the album. Lizzo’s Truth Hurts is basically unchanged. “I just took a DNA test, turns out, I’m- <strong><em>AUTISTIC</em></strong>”, with the song suddenly being interrupted by Live and Learn from Sonic Adventure 2. The artist said they were scared about putting in this joke, that it’d offend people, but are you kidding? Autistic people love Sonic. So do trans people. Autistic trans people go FERAL for Sonic.</p>

<p>This song uses Live and Learn’s backing track, with some songs over the mix, namely Green Day’s Basket Case. This album has a lot of Green Day. It also has a section right at the start, with the Avalanche’s Frontier Psychiatrist, where they say, plainly, “That boy needs therapy!”</p>

<p>This song is a therapy session. Our protagonist is at the therapist, discussing the things they’ve been hyper focusing on.</p>

<p>“Do you have the time to listen to me whine? About nothing, and everything all at once. I am one of those melodramatic fools, neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it. Sometimes I give myself the creeps. Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me. It all keeps adding up. I think I’m cracking up. Sometimes <strong>I wanna throw it all away</strong>.”</p>

<p>People with Gender Dysphoria USUALLY fear ever acting on those feelings, because society tells us it’s creepy. They’re just tricking themselves into thinking they’re a girl, anyway. They’re cracking up. Like an egg, perhaps! And then the final line is Goldfinger’s Superman, throwing in that this is all so much, it might genuinely end with self harm. This is not an easy transition to go through.</p>

<p>Then we get the chorus. Live and Learn is replaced with the very comical:</p>

<p><strong>LIVE LAUGH LOVE!</strong></p>

<p>“Always something there to remind me”</p>

<p><strong>LIVE LAUGH LOVE!</strong></p>

<p>“Cause you’re amazing, I can’t believe it”</p>

<p><strong>LIVE LAUGH LOVE!</strong></p>

<p>“I really don’t think I’m strong enough, no”</p>

<p><strong>LIVE LAUGH LOVE!</strong></p>

<p>“It’ll never be enough for me.”</p>

<p>This is our protagonist reacting to the idea that they could possibly be trans. They can’t go through with it. How could they? They’d always be reminded they’re not a “real” woman. They’re amazed by other trans women, that they could do this, but not them. They’re not strong enough. All the procedures and estrogen in the world wouldn’t be enough, they’d know what they “really” are.</p>

<p>The song continues like this for a bit, though there are a few changed lyrics. “She says my lack of sex is bringing me down” changes to “She says my <strong>sex</strong> is bringing me down”. Our protagonist gets diagnosed with gender dysphoria. But it’s not like they could really go through with this… right?</p>

<p>I’m not 100% sure what LIVE LAUGH LOVE means. Like, I know it’s a painfully optimistic phrase that helps nothing. I think that’s the idea here, that people are supplying our protagonist with platitudes that do nothing, while they have to struggle through this, practically alone, and take a giant lunge. But eventually, they do. Cue more Goldfinger.</p>

<p>“So here I am, doing everything I can, holding on to what I am, pretending I’m <strong>a man</strong>.”</p>

<p>“Danger, look behind you, there’s a stranger out to find you”.</p>

<p>The protagonist admits they’re a trans woman, but they can’t be out about it. After all, if you’re trans, there are people in this world who are practically HUNTING you. Always keeping an eye out, strangers, out to find you. Duck Tale’s “Whoo hoo!” is interspersed in the mix, more parts of the song where the vibe seems to not fit the actual theme and message of the song. On purpose, mind. This album is FANTASTIC at taking the original meanings of songs and twisting them on their heads. The next song, IMO, is the best at that.</p>

<p><strong>SHRIMPING POOL</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/6IVYv6c.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>If someone did not get the meaning of the album yet, if they’re paying attention, this is about where they usually get it. This song has a Katamari Damacy backing track, Lonely Rolling Star specifically, with the Kero Kero Bonito Song comically asking the question:</p>

<p>“How many shrimps do you have to eat, before you make your skin turn pinl? Eat too much and you’ll get sick, shrimps are pretty rich.”</p>

<p>Then we get Eiffel 65 bursting in with “Blue”, which is mostly unchanged. Yo listen up, here’s the story. He’s a blue guy, living in a blue world. etc etc. We then get one of my favorite parts of the album: Kendrick Lamar’s Swimming Pools, mixed up with Drowning Pool’s Bodies.</p>

<p>“Pour up” “Nothing wrong with me”
“Head shot” “Nothing wrong with me”
“Sit down” “Nothing wrong with me”
“Stand up” “Nothing wrong with me”
“Pass out” “Nothing wrong with me”
“Wake up” “Nothing wrong with me”
“Faded” “NOTHING WRONG WITH ME”
“Faded” “NOTHING WRONG WITH ME”</p>

<p>This turns the meanings of both songs on their heads, ESPECIALLY Drowning. What was once a song about an insane man refusing to accept it, here it’s a personal screed. Every day, they go about their life. It’s exhausting. This blue life, with these blue corvette, is exhausting. They’re faded. And all the time, inside, they know, these feelings they have? There’s nothing actually wrong with them. No matter what society says, there’s NOTHING wrong with them.</p>

<p>Then we get the chorus. Kendrick Lamar comes in with:</p>

<p>“Then somebody said, why you babysittin’ only two or three <em>shrimp</em>? I’mma show you got to turn it up an inch. First you get a swimming pool fool of <em>shrimp</em>, then you dive in it. pool full of <em>shrimp</em>, then you dive in it.”</p>

<p>This, alongside the question of “how many shrimp do you have to eat before it makes you skin turn pink”, tells you what shrimp is. It’s a metaphor for estrogen. This is a song about our protagonist getting on HRT for the first time. They’re alone and trying to go through it alone, in this blue world, but there’s a promise of pink in the future. And there are people out there willing to help him. Later additions to the chorus include:</p>

<p>“All the girls wanna play baywatch”</p>

<p>The girls in this case are other trans women, who know correctly how to dose HRT, probably more than any fucking doctor, let’s be real, and are willing to help younger trans women with advice. They’re watching the pool, so people can swim responsibly.</p>

<p>In the end, the song makes it clear.</p>

<p>“Yo listen up, here’s the story. About a little guy who lives in a blue world. <strong>CAN’T TAKE MUCH MORE</strong>. And all day, and all night, and all he wants to do is <em>turn pink</em>.</p>

<p>Our hero takes the plunge. On the advice, our protagonist begins taking shrimp.</p>

<p>I REALLY love how this song twists every single song on its head. It makes Flamingo and Blue actually HAVE meanings, Bodies is about self affirmation instead of insanity, and Swimming Pools, a song about public pressure and societal alcoholism, is now about responsibly teaching others how to take care of themselves through medical substances. It’s nuts.</p>

<p>The song also ends with Jimmy Eat World’s “The Middle” which is one of the most trans songs ever made.</p>

<p><strong>FACTS AND LODGING</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/GnZjLYa.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>This is the down point of the entire album. And it’s very, VERY heavy. The first time I heard it, I had to pause the song and stare at the wall for a second. It was nuts.</p>

<p>This is a combination of two Gorillaz songs, 19-2000 and Clint Eastwood, alongside Flobot’s Handlebars, with The Eagles’ Hotel California in the background. Most people have heard Handlebars’ first line, but not the later lines. The song goes places, so I knew it’d get… dark.</p>

<p>“The world is spinning too fast, I’m buying lead nike shoes. To keep myself tethered to the days I’ve tried to lose”</p>

<p>These Gorillaz lyrics makes it clear what the song is about. The news, the world, and society is… a lot. It’s exhausting. You need to try and keep yourself tethered.</p>

<p>We also get Supertramp’s The Logical Song hitting in with our protagonist’s internal dialogue.</p>

<p>“When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful
Oh, it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees, well, they’d be singing so happily
Oh, playfully watching me
But then they sent me away to teach me how to be sensible
Oh, responsible, practical
And then they showed me a world where I could be so dependable
Oh, intellectual, cynical”</p>

<p>Things used to be better when we were kids. Not cause they WERE better, but we could ignore them. Now it’s impossible to ignore them. Especially when you’re the target now, to a lot of society. There’s also this part I like a lot, where it jumps between Clint Eastwood and Handlebars in a way that makes it feel like these lyrics were designed to go together.</p>

<p>“Allow me to make this childlike in nature
I can ride my bike with no handlebars
Rhythm, you have it or you don’t; that’s a fallacy
I can keep rhythm with no metronome
Y’all can’t see me now ‘cause you don’t see with your eye
I can see your face on the telephone
Intangible, bet you didn’t think so I command you to
‘Cause I can lead a nation with a microphone”</p>

<p>Eventually, Supertramps begs to ask, “Please tell me who I am”, as the rest of the song explodes around them. Handlebars reaches its end, “AND I CAN END THE PLANET IN A HOLOCAUST”, and Del the Funky Homosapiens says “I SEE THE DESTRUCTION AND DEMISE, CORRUPTION IN DISGUISE”. Supertramp cries out:</p>

<p>“I said, watch what you say, or they’ll be calling you a radical. A liberal. Oh, fanatical, criminal. Ooh, it’s getting unbelievable”.</p>

<p>The world is getting to be too much. WAY too much. We can’t live like this, we can’t live our lives while all this noise happens. So, suddenly, the song COMPLETELY changes. It turns into the theme from Balatro. The only way to escape the heaviness and exhaustion of the world is escapism, games and things. But even with that, the drums from Hotel California are in the background. You can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave.</p>

<p>This is a dark, and cynical, look on society, and how we can’t really escape it. There’s no positive message here. It’s just dark.</p>

<p><strong>PINK LION CLUB</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/cQJh1cG.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>If the previous song is the down point of the album, this is where it lifts upwards again. I’ve heard a lot of interpretations on this song, but I’ve changed mine recently, thanks to suggestions by my friends on the meaning. This is a song that seems like it should be a downer. It’s Linkin Park’s Numb and Porter Robinson’s Lionhearted. Those are kinda darker songs. But they’re over the backing track of Pink Pony Club, and then as they’re going throguh with their darker lyrics, they’re interrupted by Lebo M’s He Lives in You.</p>

<p>“Wait
There’s no mountain too great
Hear the words and have faith
Havе faith
He lives in you
<em>We’ll be the lionhearted</em>
He lives in me
<em>For we don’t care about it</em>
He watches over
<em>We’ll finish what we started</em>
Everything we see
<em>So promise me that they’ll fall</em>
Into the water
<em>They broke the walls we guarded</em>
Into the truth
<em>But we don’t care about it</em>
In your reflection
<em>We’ll finish what we started</em>
He lives in you
<em>So promise me that</em>
<strong>I’ll be less like you”</strong></p>

<p>This is in contrast to the lyrics of Numb and Lionhearted. Numb is about losing faith in someone who wanted them to be a way, he can’t feel you. But Lebo M makes it clear: He’s still here. He watches over. He lives in you.</p>

<p>This song is about who we used to be, and who we will become. To a lot of trans women, they regret who they once were. They can’t feel the man they once were or might have been. But this song makes it clear. He’s still there. And that’s not a bad thing. It’s about reconnecting with yourself. You might have hated what you once were, but we can move on. After all, the man you once were is a lot like you now, with someone disappointed in you.</p>

<p>This is made clear with a break in the middle, with Bastille’s Pompei:</p>

<p>“But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like you’ve been here before?
<em>So promise me that</em>
<strong>I’m gonna be an optimist about this</strong>
<em>So promise me that</em>
<strong>I’m gonna be an optimist about this”</strong></p>

<p>A lot has changed. But also not much has changed. In spite of everything, it’s still you. Pompei’s lyrics are changed to, from “How am I gonna be an optimist about this” to “I’m gonna be an optimist about this”. Things will get better. They’ve already started.</p>

<p>This song is genuinely beautiful to me, and is my favorite on the album by far. Which means it’s probably one of my favorite songs of all time. I love this song to death.</p>

<p><strong>I’ve Had It With This Name</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Y3nQkQT.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>The early songs are a little harder to get the theme of. The album is VERY blunt fron this point on. It’s not hiding <strong>anything</strong>.</p>

<p>This is a song about self discovery. Who are you, now? Literally, what are you changing your name to? But also, what are you, who are you, and what do you want to be?</p>

<p>There’s a lot of songs here, but the main one that matters is “Somebody Told Me” by The Killer. Lyrics are shifted and changed to say things like:</p>

<p>“Breakin’ my back just to know my name
Seven tracks and I’ve had it with this name (That’s not my name! That’s not my name!)”</p>

<p>This is the seventh track.</p>

<p>“‘Cause heaven ain’t close in a place like this
I said, oh, heaven ain’t close in a place like this”</p>

<p>Whoever our protagonist was before, that’s not who they want to be. That’s not heaven. They’ll find heaven their own way.</p>

<p>Other songs move in, like REM’s End of the World. The meanings are really clear, IMO, they’re basically the original song’s meanings, but then we get a great breakdown, with Radiohead’s Creep, Coldplay’s Fix You, and Keala’ Settle’s This is Me.</p>

<p>“When you try your best, but you don’t succeed
<em>I wish I was special</em>
When you get what you want, but not what you need
<em>I want a perfect body</em>
And the tears come streamin’ down your face
<em>I don’t belong here</em>
Could it be worse?
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
<em>I don’t care if it hurts</em>
I’m gonna send a flood, gonna drown ‘em out
<em>I wanna have control</em>
But if you never try, you’ll never know
<em>What the hell am I doing here?</em>
Just what you’re worth
So tell me who are you?”</p>

<p>I’mma be real, if I didn’t know better, I’d say Creep is about a trans woman. Like, those fucking lyrics, holy hell. They’re not even changed.</p>

<p>The song ends the only way it could. With Slim Shady breaking in with “MY NAME IS-“ before getting cut off. We don’t need to know her name. We just know she’s decided who she is.</p>

<p><strong>FINALE</strong></p>

<p>Then we get the finale, which like the intro, is less a part of the story, and more outside it. A wrap up. It sets the stage and clears it up, with Gwen Stefani’s “Just a Girl”.</p>

<p>“Take this pink ribbon off my eyes
I’m exposed, and it’s no big surprise
Don’t you think I know exactly where I stand?
This world is forcing me to hold your hand
The moment that I step outside
So many reasons for me to run and hide
I can’t do the little things I hold so dear
‘Cause it’s all those little things that I fear”</p>

<p>Again, if I didn’t know better, I’d say that song is about being a trans woman. It’s uncanny.</p>

<p>The song goes through a bit of each song, as they’re all a part of our hero, and her journey. But we they come in, eventually, they’re all wiped away. What matters is the future, and what she is. We also get Gwen Stefani’s part replaced by a trans woman who covers it, quite fittingly.</p>

<p>At the very end of the song, the album is mocking you, asking you if you know the theme. Different parts from every song come in, starting with a part from THIS song, Hey Ya asking “You think you got it? Ooh, you think you got it?” It’s fucking MOCKING you. Those parts from the earlier songs move back in, repeating over and over, caucophinously, but they’re all wiped away by Gwen Stefani, making one thing clear:</p>

<p>“I’m just a girl”.</p>

<p>Then, after four repititions, it says:</p>

<p>“I’m just a girl. Can I make it any more obvious?”</p>

<p>Four more repitions, and the song ends, making it just the tiniest bit more obvious, with a scene from Celeste showing on the screen. Any more obvious, indeed.</p>

<p>So yeah, this album is fantastic. Essentially perfect, to me. A great look into gender identity and the journey to finding and being trans. This album made me feel gender euphoria. It made me feel the gender euphoria of coming out for the first time, which I haven’t felt for <strong>ten fucking years</strong>. I can never thank it enough for that. Please, please listen to it. Thanks for reading.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Music" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 178</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/08/24/OOCY178.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 178" /><published>2025-08-24T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-08-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/08/24/OOCY178</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/08/24/OOCY178.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/rKY83SY.png" alt="A page from 'Black and White'.

<p>Panic!, also known as Switch in Japan, is one of the games that, to those in the know, is a MUST get for the Sega CD. It’s a cult classic that sold like shit at the time, and reviewed about as well. Developed by Sega, it was not released here by Sega. Instead, Data East did the work to translate it, which is interesting to me.</p>

<p>The story is that all machines on the planet are infected by a virus. They are all literally sick. They do random things, often just throwing up. A program, called “Panic!”, was designed to fix the situation and return things to normal. You play as Slap and his dog Stick, very fun names, who must travel to the center of the madness and turn on Panic!.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/IHJUDag.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>In order to do this, as you enter a room, you are met with what’s going on in that room, then shown some buttons. Each button does something different. Some transport you to other rooms, some do gags. Some do both!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/XxGAkmn.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>There are 20 levels in Panic, and most of the traveling moves you from right to left, looping around. The map balloons out in the middle, before going back into a point near the end. And that’s it! What, you might say? That’s it? Where’s the gameplay? Well that’s the thing. There isn’t any. This game is literally just… you press buttons, and watch things happen.</p>

<p>There are 964 gags, though you don’t NEARLY have to watch all of them, and in order to watch all of them you basically need to game over upwards of like, 7 times, due to the way the game works. You CAN game over. Either by just beating the game, or by going to the SKULL ROOMS where a member of your family tells you to stop playing games and bullies you, or by blowing up all the monuments. Some buttons are “booby trapped”, and you get to watch famous monuments blow up and collapse. Collapse em all and it’s game over, which you’d need to do to get 100% gags anyway. Also, exits are considered gags, and some are one way. So that throws complications in too.</p>

<p>I worry I’m being reductive when I say “that’s all” to Panic. This is an EXTREMELY interesting, and fun, game. And there’s barely any game here. The humor and style is off the charts, the animation is quite good for the Sega CD, it’s smooth and flows well, and it’s very, VERY Terry Gilliam. You can tell that the devs of this LOVES Monty Python.</p>

<p>Occasionally you’ll also see scenes with these little creatures, and a voice over. The US voice over is kinda rough, but it’s not TERRIBLE. They didn’t really have to change that much, honestly. There’s even a Mega CD Bios room, which they didn’t change, at all, for the Sega CD version, even though the Sega CD Bios are NOTHING like that. There is a SINGLE room they changed, and by changed I mean literally just removed, and it was killed with kanji and would be hard to bring over here, so fair.</p>

<p>Oh, one other thing I forgot to mention, the game’s sound effects are <strong>fucking fantastic</strong>. It’s literally just one dude making all the sounds with his mouth. Gun sounds? Mouth. Explosions? Mouth. Twisting moving things? Mouth. Zippy zaps? You better believe its mouth time.</p>

<p>There are so many fun and creative rooms here, and yes, not all the jokes or humor land. There’s a lot of vomit and grossy kinda stuff, but it’s for kids, who cares. A lot of it is REALLY fun, or cute, or clever. I think my favorite room is the Mona Lisa room, though there are other great contendors.</p>

<p>I don’t recommend 100%ing this game, but frankly, even if you do, it’s just 8 hours of watching funny animations. Pace yourself. Without that, it’s an hour or two and well worth your time.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Sega CD" /><category term="Obscure Games" /><category term="Panic" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry></feed>
