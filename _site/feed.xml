<p>When I first started Retro Achievements, I went around the site hunting for games that were very important and special to me. And that usually means that I knew it extremely well, and I speedran it. That works for this game too. It’s another one I owned as a kid, and my… second speedgame? It’s up there, it was a really early one for me.</p>

<p>This is the first game ever made by a little company called Treasure, who you MAY have heard of, because they’re one of the best devs of all time. Konami alumni who got out early, they’d go on to make some AMAZING games, and were in fact working on Gunstar Heroes at the same time as this game. But this one released first. I can’t find information that this was done to fund Gunstar Heroes, but it probably was? Selling your soul early, huh Treasure?</p>

<p>I also can’t find information that this game wasn’t originally McDonalds related at all, though I wouldn’t doubt that. It has NOTHING to do with McDonalds. There’s no food here, at all… except for the tomato boss? The story is very simple. You find a piece of the treasure map, and want to find the other pieces to find some treasure. All of the pieces of the map lead to the other pieces of the map, which is not how treasure maps work but okay…. except for in Thousand Year Door, kinda. Anyway. there are four levels, each ending with a boss, through varied locations. And that’s it! The game is rather short, you could easily burst through it in 30 minutes on a first playthrough, though beginner difficulty also removes a room from levels 3 and 4, making it even shorter.</p>

<p>It’s also really easy. This is a kids game, through and through. But it’s still enjoyable to an adult, challenge just shouldn’t be a thing you’re hunting for. It looks really nice and colorful, sounds amazing, and the levels are goofy and fun, ranging from entering a monster’s stomach to traversing a sunken ship to going to space. The gameplay kicks it up a bit though. It’s a platformer, sure, though it’s a little more reminiscent of Ristar than a Mario or a Sonic. With a bit of run and gun in there, too. Ronald can shoot magic, jump, and extend his arm with some scarves up his sleeve (geddit? Cause clown?) to grab things and hang from them, like bionic commando. Though he’s static, he doesn’t swing. That’d be sick though.</p>

<p>All in all, while it isn’t anything transcendent or complex, it probably helped keep Treasure afloat long enough to make some of the best games ever made, so we have to give McDonald’s Treasure Land Adventures SOME credit for that.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Genesis" /><category term="McDonald&apos;s Treasure Land Adventures" /><category term="Platformers" /><category term="retro games" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 5</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/09/23/OOCY5.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 5" /><published>2024-09-23T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-09-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/09/23/OOCY5</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/09/23/OOCY5.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/4GrJrps.png" alt="&quot;I want you to love me, and my boobs.&quot;" class="center-block" />

<p>So I kinda like the idea of just, focusing on a console and playing a bunch of random games from that console. It’s a fun thing, gives you a snapshot into it. Plus, playing all the obscure random shit you can find in a console helps you find some real gems!</p>

<p>The PC88 is different. I was looking through the library on RA, trying to find things to play. Most of them are porn. Some of them are <strong>very bad</strong> porn, like 177. This is at least better than that. It’s just boring and bad.</p>

<p>Joshi Daisei Private, or Private Stripper, is a very simple sliding puzzle game from 1983 by Nihon Falcom. Yes, <strong>that Falcom</strong>. Before they made Ys, or Brandish, or Xanadu, or Popful Mail, or even Dragon Slayer, they made this. How does it work? Okay, you start the game, then select K for Kyoko, M for Miyuki, or Y for Yuko. Then you select Quadratic or Cubic. And then, depending on the girl you selected, you do three puzzles, sliding them in place as they get more risque, going from pinups to showing tits. Ooh, scandalous. The art is pretty bad, I’mma be real. Like they don’t have very many colors to show off, but it’s still pretty hideous.</p>

<p>In Cubic mode, all of the squares are there, and you slide an entire row or column along to slide things into the right spots. In Quadratic type, one of the tiles is missing, and you can only slide tiles into that spot. Someone in the comments said that quadratic type puzzles can be literally impossible, but that didn’t happen for me and I dunno how that’d happen. Either way, that’s just a traditional sliding puzzle alright!!</p>

<p>There’s really not much more to say. This is a VERY weird footnote in the storied history of Falcom, alright.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="PC88" /><category term="Joshi Daisei Private" /><category term="Puzzle Games" /><category term="retro games" /><category term="obscure games" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Retro Achievement Mastery 2 - Daedalian Opus</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2024/09/22/RA2-DaedalianOpus.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Retro Achievement Mastery 2 - Daedalian Opus" /><published>2024-09-22T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-09-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2024/09/22/RA2-DaedalianOpus</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2024/09/22/RA2-DaedalianOpus.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/DyUJOpj.png" alt="Daedalian Opus" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Look not every game I do has to be some big event.</p>

<p>I dunno why I discovered this game. Or why I fell in love with it. But I did. I speedran it way back in the day. It’s not a good speedrun. It’s barely a good game. It’s a 1990 puzzle game by Vik Tokai, and is very simple. You have some blocks, and you have a boaord. You can flip and rotate the blocks. Fill it in. It is a very simple pentomino jigsaw puzzle game, with a goofy silly name.</p>

<p>It’s nice pleasant little music that is nice for when you’re puzzling through a puzzle. The puzzles are all the same every time, and there are 36 of them. After puzzles you’re often given a new piece, which is then added to your pile, so it gets progressively more complex. It starts with just like simple rectangles, and then becomes almost  art pieces, things that look like rockets and shit.</p>

<p>The set was VERY simple, only progression. So I beat it in like 20 minutes. I don’t have much more to say. It’s Daedalian Opus, baybee. It’s not complex, but it doesn’t need to be. It’s just pleasant.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Game Boy" /><category term="Daedalian Opus" /><category term="puzzle games" /><category term="obscure games" /><category term="retro games" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Retro Achievement Mastery 1 - Ristar</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2024/09/22/RA1-Ristar.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Retro Achievement Mastery 1 - Ristar" /><published>2024-09-22T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-09-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2024/09/22/RA1-Ristar</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2024/09/22/RA1-Ristar.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/2Lv7cF3.png" alt="Ristar title screen" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>So a year ago, I started my journey on Retro Achievements. I’ve been posting about it a lot of Cohost, where every mastery, I talk about the game. But I started at like, game #40. So I have a lot of posts I just never made. Gonna fix that here. We’re starting from the start.</p>

<p>If you’re wondering what this series is, I basically play a game, and then do a review of it. Simple. Retro Achievements is a site where you can play a game, and it gives you achievements for it. Simple as well.</p>

<p>My first choice for a game to master was Ristar… Ristar is my favorite game of all time. I’m literally named after it. You may not have realized Lizstar is a Ristar pun, but now you do. This game is in my DNA. I know this game better than I know my own hands. I am way too close to this game.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/G6wYIQk.png" alt="Ristar " class="center-block" /></p>

<p>In Ristar you play as uh, Ristar. He’s a 90s Sega mascot, so he’s cut from the same cloth as Sonic. He’s inspired by a pitch for Sonic, which was a bunny that grabbed things with its ears. That idea evolved all the way to this. Basically, Ristar was built with one core philosophy in mind. You experience most games with your sense of sight. Can we make a game where you use your other senses? This game is all about the sense of touch. You play as a child exploring the world, reaching out and touching things, or feeling them. This game’s working title was Feel for a reason.</p>

<p>Ristar can jump and strech his arms out, just for you. He’ll grab anything he can reach, which depending on what it is, will have different effects. He might swing around on a pole. He might hand on a thing, or climb ladders. He might turn switches. Or he’ll grab the enemy and slam his entire head into it. You’ve gotta figure out what everything does in the classic way. Grabbin’ it!</p>

<p>Ristar is slower paced than Sonic. He takes his time, sauntering through levels, exploring. It’s got a lot of that same DNA though, and is just as fun. The levels are colorful, well designed. And the music is, of course, fantastic. This might be the prettiest Genesis game. It was pretty late in the console’s life cycle, so it’s not a big surprise.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/xujUvrt.png" alt="Ristar" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>The main time when Ristar speeds up is with the star poles. Ristar can grab these poles and spin around them, gaining increasingly more speed as he spins, before he releases and flies through the air. He’s hard to control, but you can explore and get to new areas this way. Again, all about that exploration!!</p>

<p>The story of the game depends on if you’re playing the JP version or not. This game actually changes a lot with the American release. In the JP release, the evil Kaiser Greedy is invading the solar system, and is taking over the planets and their leaders with his mind control magic! The people pray to their goddess Oruto for help, who sends her son Ristar. The US version keeps that kind of, except there’s no Oruto. Instead, his dad is the Galactic Hero who goes to stop Greedy, but is defeated, and Ristar has to save both the star system, and his dad. I guess they thought Americans would freak out about a non Christian God? Some of us would. There’s also other changes, like changing a cat monster to an ice monster, but both versions are fine to play.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/WToUEKs.png" alt="Ristar" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>This is not an easy game. But if you play it, you’ll find a LOT to enjoy about it. It is endlessly charming. Ristar is so cute, and he has so many fun idle animations, like making snowmen! It’s a good challenge, Greedy is one of the hardest Genesis boss fights. And of course, it’s just fun. The devs of this wanted to make a sequel, but Sega never cared about it much, and sent them all away to work on Nights into Dreams. Which y’know, is a good game. But I wish more had been done with my boy.</p>

<p>The actual set was good too btw. Though it had an achievement for grinding out points, which was kinda boring and annoying lol</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Genesis" /><category term="Ristar" /><category term="platformer" /><category term="retro games" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 4</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/09/22/OOCY4.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 4" /><published>2024-09-22T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-09-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/09/22/OOCY4</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/09/22/OOCY4.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/HL0gfPl.png" alt="&quot;That girl and I just aren't on the same wavelength.
