<p>It’s literally just Mario 64, entirely, with no changes. Except when you click someowhere, Mario moves there. When you right click, a menu pops up, and you can select from a long list of commands.

<p>So after playing Dragon Quest 4, I was in a bit of a Dragon Quest kick again. I decided to take advantage of this by playing one of the many, MANY re-releases of the games that exist, starting with Dragon Quest 1&amp;2 on the Gameboy. This is a combo package of… well, DQ1+2. Its what it says on the tin.</p>

<p>This came out in 2000, so over a decade after Dragon Quest originally did. Though it’s not actually the first re-release. DQ1 and 2 also got a release, as a single package, on the SNES. Obviously this is nothing like that, because that’s a major graphical overhaul. I’ll have to play it someday.</p>

<p>I played this off stream, because DQ1 is such a chill cozy game to me. It’s a nice grindy game to relax to while watching something, and I beat it in like 4-5 hours. I know it very well by this point. DQ2, on the other hand, was a bit more effort. I had only ever beaten DQ2 one other time before this, last year, so I didn’t know it NEARLY as well.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/R2g0vmi.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>The games are MOSTLY the same, but there are some significant differences. The graphics, of course, but there’s some different equipment in 1, backported from 2, and it felt like the grind went even faster than it does on the NES, so maybe numbers were upped too. Oh also the translation is different, so she’s no longer Erdrick, she’s Loto now. I prefer Erdrick. In DQ2, numbers were upped a bit again, it’s still kinda hard and rude, but it’s a lot less rude feeling than it was on the NES. The most notably differences, however, is you can get puff puff in DQ1 now, and in DQ2, there’s a scene where the Prince, the 2nd character you meet, gets sick and you need to heal him to get him back in the party. Which is NOT needed to beat the game, so you  can beat the game with only two characters from that point on. As a challenge, I guess. I did not do that.</p>

<p>Dragon Quest, and many games from this point on, would begin re-releasing their older games adnauseum. But most of the time these days, it’s a super up to date version, or just the old version again with no differences. This was interesting. They could have made DQ1+2 on like, PS1 or something, but they didn’t. They used an 8-bit machine. So it’s really just DQ1 and 2 again, but with slightly different graphics, and slightly updated UI. Which hey, I like those games, so why not, right?</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Gameboy" /><category term="Retro Games" /><category term="Dragon Quest" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Retro Achievements Unmastered 4 - Digital Devil Story - Megami Tensei</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/07/30/RAUM4-MT1.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Retro Achievements Unmastered 4 - Digital Devil Story - Megami Tensei" /><published>2025-07-30T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-07-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/07/30/RAUM4-MT1</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/07/30/RAUM4-MT1.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/acCOcH6.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>I made the Unmastered series of posts to showcase games that I beat, did not master, but still wanted to review. This is a bit different. I actually did not beat this game. But I’m playing the sequel, and loving it, and expect to master it, so to talk about it, I wanted to talk about this one too, for context. There’s also a lot to talk about.</p>

<p>Megami Tensei is one of the most important RPG series of all time. Kind of. See, Megami Tensei was pretty popular, then it got a spinoff series called Shin Megami Tensei, which superceded the series and became so much more popular people forgot the original existed. And then that series got a spinoff series called Persona. And now some people don’t even know about SMT. And even LESS know about and remember MT. Even even LESS know about and remember the fucking book series that this game was based on. But is that fair? Let’s see where this series started, and determine if it’s unfairly forgotten…</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/rXevEMk.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Megami Tensei is a sequel to the novels. Basically, the idea is that Nakajima invented a computer program that let him summon Demons into this world. He used it to try and get back at and scare some bullies, but it went WAY too far, and now he’s trying to stop the Demons. There’s also stuff about him and his gf Yumiko being a reincarnated God, I dunno, I didn’t get to any part where that’s mentioned, if it is in this game. This game is VERY low on story, character, or plot, but the basic idea is you need to traverse this labyrinth and find and defeat Lucifer. Along the way you’ll explore different areas and defeat the generals there before finally fighting Lucifer. There aren’t really any smaller stories in this areas either, it’s pretty straight forward.</p>

<p>And now, the gameplay. Megami Tensei is a dungeon crawling RPG in the style of Wizardry. In fact, it’s basically just a Wizardry game. And, look… I like retro RPGs. A lot. I REALLY love NES era RPGs, ones people say “aged poorly”. I will happily play Dragon Quest 1 until the cows come home. But this… this feels like it goes beyond aged poorly. It’s missing so much shit that we take for granted today, and utilizes it in ways that fucking hate the player. This game is very, VERY rude. And it, like Dragon Quest, is almost completely a grind-fest. But it does NOT make that easy, or pleasant, to accomplish.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/mtIcl6u.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>You have stat allocation. Be sure to allocate it correctly, or you’re fucked. There’s a single place to save the game, heal, fuse monsters, and cure status effects. You can get spells to do some of these things, but if you get to the deeper areas, and Yumiko gets hit by a numb status effect, you gotta wander aaaalll the way back to undo it. While draining health, and being attacked by a ridiculous encounter rate. When you enter a door, the encounter rate is like, 60%. Also, the game crashes. A lot. A LOOOOOT.</p>

<p>But that pales in comparison to the #1 most fucked up thing I’ve ever seen in an RPG like this. Some enemies have attacks that drain your levels. Yes. ENTIRE LEVELS. Just, boom, hit by this enemy? Your levels are gone. You can run sure, but you’ll probably fail running at the worst time… and since you’re grinding like crazy, you’re probably on autopilot anyway, so you’ll miss that you’re fighting the level draining enemies, and suddenly whoops, 2 hours of effort is gone.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/dNFgWp5.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>So, what DOES Megaten bring to the table? It’s not just a rehash of Wizardry with really rude mechanics. It DOES have a lot of cool ideas, but they’re also implemented…. weirdly. This game has a monster catching mechanic! You can befriend monsters then summon them using your computer. They drain resources when they’re out, but you usually make back more than you drain if you’re just killing everything. They gain no levels, but are invaluable. You can also fuse them together to create new demons. Very useful, and neccesary to continue. It’s confusing and needs a guide for you to get anything done, but still, cool idea.</p>

<p>What ISN’T cool is the monster catching itself. In later games, you can influence it slightly. In this game, it’s all RNG baybee. Good fucking luck. And many demons just can’t be tamed, so you’d never fucking know, but they can and WILL take your bribes, just like all the ones that can, so you’ll just assume you’re VERY unlucky.</p>

<p>Megaten is… a rough game. It was cool for the time and had some good ideas, but frankly, there’s no reason to ever go back to play this now. Just play Megami Tensei 2.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="NES" /><category term="retro games" /><category term="Megami Tensei" /><category term="RPGs" /><category term="Reviews" /><category term="Unmastered" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 168</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/07/29/OOCY168.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 168" /><published>2025-07-29T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-07-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/07/29/OOCY168</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/07/29/OOCY168.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/PDdBpKW.png" alt="'Two girls look back at each other, one on a train that's about to move away.

<p>Last year I played Dragon Quest 1-3. I’d only ever beaten DQ1 before, but I was a huge fan of it as a kid, so I was excited to finally sit down and beat DQ2 and 3. I’d played them, but never got very far. This one I had barely played at ALL, and put off until this year because it’s the start of a new series! Dragon Quest 4 is a new step for the series, and I’d heard it was good, but I REALLY liked 3, so I didn’t expect it to quite reach those heights.</p>

<p>Uh, I was fucking wrong. Dragon Quest 4 blew my fucking mind. This might actually just straight up be my favorite RPG on the NES now. Mother 1 is still holding on, but I’ll be real, it’s close.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/xpJGjhl.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Dragon Quest 4 tries for a new thing for the series: a plot! That’s a joke, but also kinda not. DQ1-3 had very mild plots. 3 had a bit more of it, but it was really about the scene to scene stuff. This game not only has a plot, but it also goes about it in a unique and interesting way. This game has like 7 heroes, and it introduces you to each of them by each chapter, as they’re doing their own things. Finally, after all their chapters, you’re introduced to YOU, the main character, the chosen hero, and the game fully opens up, with you collecting the crew and saving the world. Notably, you can also be a woman! And the game actually acknowledges that fact and doesn’t just fucking ignore it, like it did in DQ3!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/g5aODwl.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>The different chapters range from your typical kinda fantasy story to very unique weird shit. Like, it starts with a knight trying to find kids who’ve been kidnapped by monsters. By the later chapters you’re a merchant trying to save up money for his own store, with unique mechanics exclusive to him about trying to get as much money as you can.</p>

<p>So, other than the story, what does this game have going for it? Well, it’s more Dragon Quest! And I really like NES Dragon Quest. It plays well, is well balanced, has fun progression, and has a LOT of extra content. This is the first game with little medals, for example. And they’re VERY well hidden, too, as they usually are.</p>

<p>Frankly, I don’t have that much more to add?? Like… it’s just an EXTREMELY high quality NES RPG. It’s still an NES RPG. You will have to grind. You will get confused about where to go on occasion, though it’s got a lot of QOL shit that earlier games REALLY did not have. Shout outs to the Return spell taking you to any town, yay. I’m excited to replay this someday with the DS version. But for now, it’s just fantastic, and I highly recommend it.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="NES" /><category term="Retro Games" /><category term="Dragon Quest" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Retro Achievement Mastery 191 - Where in Hell is Carmen Santiago</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/07/27/RA191-WhereInHell.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Retro Achievement Mastery 191 - Where in Hell is Carmen Santiago" /><published>2025-07-27T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-07-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/07/27/RA191-WhereInHell</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/07/27/RA191-WhereInHell.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/fhqU3q3.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>This is maybe one of the more interesting games I’ve ever played for this project. This is Where In Hell Is Carmen Santiago, and first we have to discuss what it is. Retro Achievements describes it as a “homebrew”, though notably, it came out in 1990. Japan has a word for games like these: Doujin. Self published games. But English really only has the term Homebrew, which is a newer term and doesn’t quite fit. It’s good enough.</p>

<p>This game was made by St. John M. Morrison in 1990, and that man is a MASSIVE nerd. You’ve got to be a huge dork to make an Apple II homebrew, but this guy really was a huge computer nerd. But let me first put you in the mind of a nerd paying attention to Apple II products in the late 80s.</p>

<p>Carmen Sandiego was a huge hit, and many jokes were made about it. I remember one I often heard: Where the hell is Carmen Sandiego? Well, Mr. Morrison took that joke and decided to run with it. This is both a Carmen Sandiego game, and an ecucational game, teaching you all about Dante’s Inferno! Well, it’s not actually very educational, but that’s okay. I actually studied Dante in college and wrote my thesis on him so like, I’m at least well versed in this shit.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/FKpqezW.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>In Where In The Hell, you must walk through Hell and interrogate V.I.L.E members, who are souls burning in Hell for historical crimes, in order to find where Carmen Santiago lies. Hell in Dante’s model is basically a straight line, going deeper, with each layer having the souls suffer for a different sin. You can move up and down, use items you find, look around to learn more about the layer, search for items, or call a name. When you call a name, you have a list of the V.I.L.E souls, and must theorize about whether that soul will be in that layer. If you guess right, they’ll come out, and you can interrogate them and ask them for items to help you on your quest. These items are things that let you get past later obstacles, basically.</p>

<p>It’s not actually that educational and is a lot of trial and error. But eventually you’ll find Carmen and she gives you an item to escape. And that’s it, right? Nope! This game has a second mode, known as “Pit of the Programs”. Remember how I told you Mr. Morrison was a MASSIVE computer nerd? We’re putting that to the test.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ITdhFlp.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>All of the historical souls are replaced with characters that are references to popular edutainment games on the Apple II, like Stickybear or Reader Rabbit, turning into Stinkybear or Reaver Rabbit. Or, they’re referencing computer concepts, like vaporware. The map of Hell is the same, but its WAY more trial and error to try and find out where the hell anyone is and what they do. And it’s all just one big joke. It’s kind of a funny joke! One I like. But a joke.</p>

<p>This is a fascinating little program. It’s mostly making fun of a popular game of the time, and is… interesting, but I dunno if you need to play it? But you SHOULD know it exists.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Apple II" /><category term="Homebrew" /><category term="Carmen Sandiego" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 167</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/07/27/OOCY167.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 167" /><published>2025-07-27T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-07-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/07/27/OOCY167</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/07/27/OOCY167.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/WOmnhfP.png" alt="'I think two girls clinging onto each other is a wonderful thing!
