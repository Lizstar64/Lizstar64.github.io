<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p><strong>Riddles</strong> - VOY
8/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/L12TVW2.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Neelix and Tuvok are on the Delta Flyer, which is WAY fucking larger than I thought it was. Neelix is annoying Tuvok, who as usual, seems to detest everyone he’s ever met, but ESPECIALLY Neelix. Maybe it’s espcially weird between them considering The Episode That Must Not Be Mentioned. Anyways Tuvok gets grumpy after Neelix gives him a bad riddle, he goes back to the back to find that an alien is downloading some files from the computer. It attacks Neelix and he has a seizure.</p>

<p>They get some information from a nearby alien species. The ambasaddor to them believes it’s a species called The Ba’Neth, which his government claims does not actually exist. He’s basically a conspiracy theorist about these guys, adamant they DO exist, even though no one’s ever seen them, and there have only been 13 known attacks. Tuvok was the first attacked who survived! Lucky Tuvok.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/wQljDTM.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Neelix feels guilty for what happened to Tuvok, so he does his best to make Tuvok comfy. The Doctor suggests that sometimes people wake from comas if they’re talked to or have smells, so Neelix goes ALL OUT. It works, and Tuvok wakes up, though his brain has been damaged, so he’s kind of running on instinct. He’s scared of the tricorder, for example. Neelix takes him on tours to try and jog his memory, and everyone is kind of worried and disturbed. They don’t know if he’ll ever recover.</p>

<p>They study the Ba’Neth and find out how to decloak them, using some fancy technology. THey use it and find out, whoopsies, there’s A FLEET OUT THERE WATCHING THEM. They attack and then scramble, running away.</p>

<p>Neli just asked “is this episode Tuvok’s brain”. Uh oh. Tuvok is talking again, but he’s kind of kid-like. He has emotions, he doesn’t much care for logic and meditation. He’s also kind of angsty about what happened to him, understandably. They know that he got a cloaking frequency before being attacked, and they need it to find the aliens. He doesn’t remember though. He, and everyone else, are kinda upset at the fact that Tuvok isn’t really Tuvok anymore, and might never be again. Seven puts it eloquently. She changed, quite a lot. And she was helped, not by trying to force her back to what she was.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/1KZDkqM.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>I like this new Tuvok. He likes having fun. He likes smiling. He likes jazz. He ends up LOVING cooking, and specifically deserts. Why? Because “it tastes good”. Fair enough, man!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/CNNCJIG.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>He still can’t remember the cloaking frequency. But he writes it out on a cake he’s making.</p>

<p>They find the aliens, and the investigator they’re with makes a good offer. His device he made to find them, in exchange for the weapon they attacked Tuvok with so they can help Tuvok. They do it, and make a way to fix Tuvok.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/sp0hg9B.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Tuvok is not happy about this. He likes who he is NOW. He can enjoy things, and be with his best friend Neelix! He knows if he goes back to the way he was, he’ll probably just avoid Neelix again. “How will you know how much I enjoy your company?” “Well, you just told me”. AWWWW. That really gave me feels. Can you imagine if Tuvok just stayed like this for the entire series??? No obviously not, though he’s gone, he’s not gone FOREVER. Tuvok has a little less logic in him. Just a little less.</p>

<p><strong>Dragon’s Teeth</strong> - VOY
7/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/MWSH6y2.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We start IMMEDIATELY with a bombing of a city. Two aliens get in biopods to try and survive an attack. They’ll wake up 5 years later, and hopefully then the war will be over.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on Voyager, they’re in some wormhole. By accident. An alien ship inside tells them to get the fuck out, which they’re like “We’d love to but how” so they push them out. The aliens then go “Prepare to be boarded, we’re going to wipe your computer so you don’t have records of our space”. Janeway obviously ain’t gonna allow that, so they’re attacked, and they flee to a nearby planet that’s highly irradiated to try and escape. It works, but the aliens are still hovering above. Scans show that the entire planet became nuclear dust 892 years ago. That’s a bit more than 5 years.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/QoDpDnV.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They awaken one of them. The other is dead, her machine not functioning. Horrifying. He explains he’s a Vaadwaur. Things have changed a LOT. He knows of the Talax-ilzay, the predecessors of the Talaxians. He knows of the Borg, back when they were a small group. In the old Talaxian language btw, Vaudwar means “foolish”. I’m sure that’ll mean nothing. This guy, Gedrin, makes a suggestion. Wake up his batallion, help them off the planet, and he’ll help them through “underspace”, some wormhole tunnels that can lead them closer to his own.</p>

<p>They wake them up and work with them. Looks like this alliance will go well! Well, the first cracks that come up are actually with Naomi. She doesn’t like the Vaudwar kids. They called Neelix stupid, like all his race. Jerks &gt;:(</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/fB3ksWI.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Yeah turns out the Vaudwaur are empiralistic and awful. They promised to help Voyager get home faster. Now they refuse to unless given weapons. They want what was once their’s, and they’ll do whatever they can to get it. And their new plan is to kill the people on Voyager and take the ship as their own, with its superior technology. Yeah that’s a GREAT idea, Voyager, the only thing keeping you alive right now from the violent race that hates you upstairs.</p>

<p>Neelix and Seven study the Vaudwar and find what they used to be like. Janeway confronts the leader, the original one they released, Gedrin. He’s like “Well yeah we USED to be aggressive but not anymore!” My man, YOU’RE THE SAME EXACT PEOPLE. Not just descendants, the same people.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/BS77cbR.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This episode has a BUDGET. Janeway is prepared for them to be betrayed, and sure enough they are. They contact the aliens in orbit, old enemies of the Vaudwar, who are willing to help if they blow up the Vaudwar. They need to access a satellite though. Gedrin offers to help, as “not all of [his] people are stuck in the past”. He sacrifices himself so Voyager can escape. The rest of the Vaudwar are stuck fighting the Turei, the other aliens. Some Vaudwar manage to escape though and survive, so they’re still out there, and might become a threat… in STAR WARS ONLINE! Which isn’t canon but that’s okay.</p>

<p><strong>One Small Step</strong> - VOY
7/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/j0jejZB.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Weird-ass image for this episode, but its literally the first thing we see. We watch a NASA ship above Mars in the 21st century, as its suddenly confronted with some super large thing coming at it.</p>

<p>Now back on Voyager, some things are malfunctioning. Turns out it’s Seven’s fault. She’s like “I’m just upgrading the systems, it’s causing minor malfunctions”. “Seven that’s not up to you” “I will do it anyway” Seven we’ve had this conversation like eight times, where the hell is your character development. THen they get close to a “Graviton Elipse”, which the last time that was detected, it was a Mars mission that ended up stranding some people on Mars for weeks.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/2v3nXVQ.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They want to study it and get closer to it. Seven thinks they’re nuts. They think the NASA command center is in there, and find data from it, so they wanna go in and find it for themselves. Seven still thinks they’re nuts. She doesn’t understand this… “hero worship” or trying to make yourself a part of history. It’s highly illogical. Even TUVOK is into it. As he says, he IS a Starfleet officer. He’s here because he’s an explorer.</p>

<p>Tom, Seven, and Chakotay go into the Anomoly. Chakotay is so overwhelmed and excited by being in there, he wants to study everything they find in there. But they don’t have time, the anomaly is going to impact a dark matter asteroid and it’ll be Bad to be in there. But Chakotay is too up his own ass and doesn’t want to leave, so the impact happens and Chakotay gets shocked by a console in the Delta Flyer. The Flyer is damaged, they have two hours before it reaches subpsace, the engines are unsalvagable. That’s Bad.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/0idQrsz.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Seven is PISSED. Chakotay disobeyed orders and put everyone’s lives at risk. He SHOULD be court martialed, if he’s lucky. And by that I mean if WE’RE lucky. But nothing’s gonna happen to him, of course.</p>

<p>They send Seven over to the NASA shuttle to try and get some parts from it for salvage. They find some logs from the guy who disappeared into the anomaly. He did, in fact, survive. For a while. That’s fucking horrifying. This is a survival horror audio log. The rest of the episode is just them listening to this guy’s survival horror log as he dies. As he dies though, he makes a statement that it was right for them to come here, because he’s learned from all the debris out there that they’re not alone, and some day, someone might find the data he collected and learn from it.</p>

<p>They make it out, with his data and his corpse, and give him a proper sendoff. Seven now has a better appreciation of history and exploration.</p>

<p>So parts of this were great. All the stuff with the NASA survivor? Fantastic. Chakotay was annoying and bad as always, but we have a thing in our group called The Rule of Chakotay. Just cause Chakotay is in an episode and does something bad doesn’t make the entire episode bad, like how the Rule of Data means Data being good doesn’t mean the episode is neccesarily good.</p>

<p><strong>The Voyager Conspiracy</strong> - VOY
7/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/toBrgPO.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Seven is setting up a machine that’ll download information into her brain as she sleeps so she doesn’t have to study it like the primitives. I’m sure this won’t go wrong in any way. Hey remember that episode where Barclay downloaded so much information he became super smart or whatever? Anyway.</p>

<p>She wakes up and immediately calls Torres. I imagine this happens a lot after this episode. “TORRES, I DOWNLOADED INFORMATION LAST NIGHT. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF SKA?” This episode then goes into what is basically a Sherlock Holmes jump through what happened six weeks ago. She theorizes from some base information some bugs are making their nest in the ship’s computers, and yes, they are. So clearly this thing works.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/XABjX4v.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Voyager comes across an alien named Tash. He was stranded here years ago, and has been building a Super Catapult to throw him across space, basically. What a coincidence, WE want to be thrown across space! Voyager offers to help him fix his catapult if they can use it after he does, and they see it’s safe. He’s 100% down, just excited to be able to finish his catapult. Seven wakes up, and warns them. She thinks this is a trap. She believes the technology from the catapult is the same as the one that the Caretaker used to bring them here in the first place.</p>

<p>What proceeds is what I can only describe as a clipshow. I made a joke during that earlier episode with the Vaudwar that the budget was so inflated with CGI battles and shit that we’d be getting a clipshow later this season to pay for it, AND BEHOLD. Seven explains that she believes there’s a conspiracy going on, and goes over events that happened years ago. We see scenes and information from SEASONS ago. It’s done as well as it can be, but there’s really only one reason to reuse scenes in a Trek show, and that’s to save money. It’s why we’ve seen that Klingon ship from one of the early movies explode like 12 times by now.</p>

<p>After all her studying and thoughts, she believes that Janeway and Tuvok intentionally stranded everyone here in order to set up a military presence in the Delta Quadrant. Which goes against all of Janeway’s ideals, not to mention any amount of logic. If you were going to send a ship to establish a military presence in a far off region of space, why would you send Voyager, a rinky dink science vessel that’s exploded like a million times in different timelines???? Neli theorizes that this is something the writers saw people talking about in early internet forums and decided to make fun of. I agree. Our conspiracy theory is much funnire than Seven’s.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/FisaI1W.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This is Chakotay’s expression listening to Seven’s ludicrous screed. It’s fucking HILARIOUS. But the worst part is it seems he’s starting to fucking buy it??? Chakotay are you <strong><em>fucking kidding me????</em></strong> “Seven has some compelling evidence” NO SHE FUCKING DOES NOT. This is some “Photon torpedos won’t melt steel beams” shit.</p>

<p>Seven downloads more information, and then immediately calls Janeway. She believes now that Chakotay is planning a coup to restart the Maquis rebellion. Janeway is like “…..did Chakotay put you up to this what the fuck”. I think Seven’s just broken. Now Janeway and Chakotay assume each other, but they kind of ACCIDENTALLY let slip to each other they’re suspicious cause of stuff Seven has told them and then they’re like “wait this is stupid” just as Seven leaves in the Delta Flyer.</p>

<p>Janeway beams aboard to try and convince Seven to turn around, and she’s like “it’s no use, I know your TRUE REASON for being here! You came here to kidnap me!” She’s fucking broooooken. Janeway convinces her that she’s not here to hurt her, because she’s malfunctioning, and she cares about her. She gives examples of all the times she helped her and cared about her. It’s very straight.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Qh1U7nT.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>I don’t THINK there were any Seven/Janeway shippers making this show, but I wouldn’t be that surprised.</p>

<p>Seven comes back, they fix her, and everything is good. They also use the catapult to get 3 years closer to home! Chakotay and Janeway joke about it. “You didn’t poison the coffee, did you?” “No more than usual.” This episode was stupid as fuck but honestly really funny.</p>

<p><strong>Pathfinder</strong> - VOY
6.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/igVwUix.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Holy shit it’s Barclay. Holy FUCK, it’s Troi! She looks so good in the modern outfit. It’s nice to see her! She’s visiting Barclay as the Enterprise is docked at Earth. Barclay is his usual nervous weird self. He’s been working on something called the “Pathfinder Project”, but he’s stopped working on it. Hints at things going wrong happen quickly. He has a cat! The cat’s name is Neelix. That’s probably not a coincidence. Barclay is afraid he’s becoming obsessed with Voyager.</p>

<p>He tells the story to Troi. He believed he could establish two way communication with Voyager, but Rej’s theories are… far fetched. You know that meme about Human engineers in Trek trying to turn the sun into a Torus? That’s Rej. He’s alienating himself from his friends and coworkers by obsessing with this. It’s mostly cause he wants to help the Voyager crew so much. He couldn’t sleep, he couldn’t focus on work, he once again got addicted to the holodeck, using a Voyager simulation that he invented based on info about Voyager.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/LreYzKV.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>It’s not ACCURATE information, and he’s practically using it as a second life MMO to live out a fantasy of helping these people and living on Voyager. Barclay is as uncomfortable and awkward to watch as he was on TNG. He makes an ass out of himself in front of Paris’ Admiral dad. He also tells Troi it’s totally NOT a relapse of his holo addiction, and she gives him a VERY funny “okay, sure” look. All of this gets him kicked off the project, and he wants Troi to tell the Admiral to put him back on the project, that he’s totally mentally fit to work. Troi refuses cause uh, he’s not. He’s unstable as fuck. He admits that a lot of this is because he’s no longer on the Enterprise. They were his family, now his family is Voyager. They’re all he has left.</p>

<p>He hacks his way into his work place later that night. He’s going to get the thing working so they can communicate with Voyager, if it’s the last thing he does. If he’s caught it WILL be.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/u874URw.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Hey look, the thing! Barclay’s boss comes in and tries to stop him before Barclay can do… whatever he’s doing. So uh, everything explained here shows what Barclay is doing isn’t DANGEROUS or BAD. It is something that his boss has been pushing back against mostly out of frustration with Barclay being the way he is. They could just let Barclay do this for 20 minutes but whatever. Then there’d be no episode I guess. Rej is caught, and the program ends, after he ends a few messages.</p>

<p>Back on board the ACTUAL Voyager, Seven is trying to teach Neelix to sing, much to her chagrin. But then they get a message! Well, send one back!!</p>

<p>Back in Starfleet, Rej is about to be arrested (ironically, Admiral Paris actually was about to give permission for Barclay to do this, buuuuut he was a bit too impatient), but they’re interrupted by Janeway pushing through a message. Finally, Voyager has direct voice contact for the first time.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/nRGFDcS.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Paris hears that his son is there, and is an exemplary member of the crew. Not gonna mention he got demoted the other month, I guess. It looks like regular communication might happen. They also make Barclay, “whoever you are”, an honorary crew of Voyager. That’s cute.</p>

<p>Most of this episode was awkward and just okay, but the last bit was really good to see, after six seasons of build up, the emotional gut punch of them finally making voice contact.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="Voyager" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 145</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/05/17/OOCY145.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 145" /><published>2025-05-17T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-05-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/05/17/OOCY145</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/05/17/OOCY145.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Fe0m042.png" alt="'Well, I can understand how the rain clouds feel now.

<p>There’s a kind of puzzle that’s pretty common in games. You have a bunch of squares, and you can move along them squares. How do you fill in all those squares without stepping back over a square? What path do you take? It’s a puzzle I personally associate with the Zelda Oracle games, but it’s pretty common elsewhere too. Like here!</p>

<p>This is Pyramids of Ra, a 2018 homebrew Apple II game by Naspite Labs. Seems like a pretty simple homebrew, at least in gameplay. For music, they ported like, a lot of hard techno and keygen jams to Apple II. And considering the computer’s limited musical capabilities, it’s very crunchy and hurts the ears.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/0nl3suN.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Later on, it introduces different color tiles, which require you to clear them twice, or even three times. Simple progression. After 12-ish stages, the game is done. It’s pretty easy, even considering the concept, but I like a puzzle like this, and it doesn’t HAVE to be complex or wild to be enjoyable for 20 minutes.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Apple" /><category term="Obscure games" /><category term="Pyramids of Ra" /><category term="Homebrew" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 144</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/05/15/OOCY144.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 144" /><published>2025-05-15T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-05-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/05/15/OOCY144</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/05/15/OOCY144.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Fymyyxn.png" alt="'It's so absurd but these stupid men get reeled in every time.

<p>I don’t know if this is so much a thing anymore, but when I was a kid, computers were JUST starting to become bigger and bigger, and used for things that weren’t like, landing shit on the moon. And that included in schools. My media center was getting new computers, and they were trying to find ways to use computers for education. One of those ways was for testing. I remember one of the first times I really used the computer at my school for things that weren’t like, teaching how to type or playing games, was a book test. I don’t know if they still do that anymore, but that’s all this program is. It’s a test on a book that you’d teach in schools.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/VMBUV6L.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>I have never read Bridge to Terabithia. Not once. I knew absolutely nothing about it going in, except that I’d heard the name before. It’s a popular book from like, the 60s or 70s that they taught in schools, never taught it to me though. Anyways, the test is several parts, very simple, ranging from answering basic plot questions to putting events in order.</p>

<p>Like I said, I’ve never read this book, but I managed to do very well on the test. Why, am I psychic? Well, I DID go to school for literature. I know how books work. And this is a basic test for babies on a simple kids book. It appears to be a fucking DARK kids book, like, wow. But it’s still for younger audiences. So I know how basic story structure works, and I used context clues and judgement to guess how the story went, and y’know what, I got it right, pretty much every time. And even if I missed a question I could just redo the test, cause what was stoppign me?</p>

<p>This is a weird review, cause like, it’s not a game. It’s not a game at ALL. It’s barely even educational, it’s just a test, it doesn’t teach anything, it tests you on what you’ve been taught elsewhere. But this was a thing back then, and this was how I first interracted with computers, so it’s important to me for that.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Apple" /><category term="Obscure games" /><category term="Bridge to Terabithia" /><category term="Text Adventures" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">LizstarTrek - Voyager Season 5 episodes 1-5</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/lizstartrek/2025/05/12/LizstartrekVOY6-1.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="LizstarTrek - Voyager Season 5 episodes 1-5" /><published>2025-05-12T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-05-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/lizstartrek/2025/05/12/LizstartrekVOY6-1</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/lizstartrek/2025/05/12/LizstartrekVOY6-1.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Tx1t43y.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p><strong>Equinox, Part II</strong> - VOY
1/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/vhvdaMr.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Voyager is still under attack by those nucleogenic aliens, after the Equinox ditched them. Chokie is hit by an alien and given a wild scar, but unfortunately he’s still alive. They kidnapped Seven, and also possibly the Doctor? They still have the Doctor’s emitter, but it’s filled with Evil Doctor instead.</p>

<p>Back on the Equinox, Captain Ransom talks to Seven, hoping that she’ll join them and help them. “You can be in the brig for a month until we get home, or join our crew. I’d prefer the latter.” “I would prefer the brig” “Janeway isn’t the ONLY person who can help you explore your humanity, you know”</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/fjMCKn9.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>God DAMN, Seven. Anyways their stuff is locked by some codes, so they demand Seven do it. She refuses. So they bring the Doctor up and delete his ethical subroutines so he’ll do it. He agrees immediately. God, PLEASE make it so that he’s just faking. Sadly no, he doesn’t seem to be. But the thing about ripping out the memories would basically kill Seven.</p>

<p>Janeway wants to chase the Equinox to get Seven and the important Voyager parts they stole. Chokie wants to let it go and focus on Voyager, leaving Seven behind. Chokie, dude, they stole the part that makes you go vroom. He claims its all about revenge for Janeway, as it always is. What. “You’ve been known to hold a grudge” She has been?? THey focus way more on her want to stop Ransom than her want to save Seven, which disappoints the shit out of me. She has big Captain Ahab energy. Ugh.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/xbsBRPY.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They chase after Equinox, but lose the fight. Which SEEMS stupid, but their systems are VERY taxed to hold off the aliens. Janeway feels really off this episode. They capture one of the members of the Equinox, and Janeway tries to get information out of him. When he refuses, she attempts to murder him by letting the aliens eat him. Chakotay comes in and saves him like “What the HELL Are you doing?!” This is REALLY fucked up of Janeway, and a very sudden 180. She’s doing the Ransom fall to darkness kind of thing, putting her morals away for a thing she feels she needs to do.</p>

<p>She ends up demoting Chokie and confining him to quarters, but follows his suggestion to meet the aliens who worship the extra dimensional aliens. She does, they’re like “we’ll stop attacking if you let us kill everyone on the Equinox” and she agrees, which disturbs Tuvok greatly. What the fuck is she doing?</p>

<p>And while Janeway has her 180, you know who else does? Ransom. He’s like “actually this is wrong and I need to do what’s right”. NOW? NOW YOU DECIDE THAT?! It’s too late though, when he tries to call them off and surrender to Voyager, he’s thrown in the brig by his second in command who takes control. The anxious ensign escorts him off. She’s just following orders, you understand. But actually she’s working with him and helps him break out to stop whatever the hell is going on.</p>

<p>Everything about this is stupid to me I’m ngl. What is it with Star Trek and not hitting the landing?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/fvesr0m.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Ransom shuts down their shields, and Max is now the bad guy. He refuses to go in Voyager’s brig, and would rather be stuck on a shuttle forever. So he fucking dies to the aliens, and the entire Equinox blows up, Ransom along with it. Everyone else is rescued. Everyone is sad about this. Janeway is like “He was still a Starfleet officer. He just forgot about it for a while.” YEAH, MY MAN. SO DID YOU??</p>

<p>They let the Equinox crew join them, but demoted and they’ll have to earn their trust. Janeway and Chokie are still tense. She acknowledged he probably should have mutinied against her. He says that would have been crossing a line. Then they hang the Voyager plaque back on the wall, which is poetic, I guess.</p>

<p>I want to quote one of the producer, Ronald Moore, about this episode: “The things that Janeway does in ‘Equinox’ don’t work, because it’s not about anything. She’s not really grappling with her inner demons. She’s not truly under the gun and suffering to the point where you can understand the decisions that she’s made. She just gets kind of cranky and bitchy. She’s having a bad day”. And it really just feel like that. This episode fucking blew. It RUINED what was an absolutely fantastic season finale and a great concept. Complete fuck up.</p>

<p><strong>Survival Instinct</strong> - VOY
7/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/4y6pNHu.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We have some scenes of Seven has a Borg with her unimatrix on a planet, then we jump back forward to the present. Voyager has docked at a pleasant location with a lot of alien traders, it’s nice! Seven is unhappy about this. Not cause it’s bad, just cause she’s bad with crowds. Her and Naomi try to eat quietly, but are accosted by a random guy who offers her some Borg implants he said he found for trade. They’re implants from her old unimatrix. She takes them then leaves to study it. The guy is then rude to Naomi, so clearly he’s not trustworthy.</p>

<p>We get more scenes of her and her unimatrix. They’re all acting a little weird. They’re y’know, talking, for one. But also they’re acting more like they’re already freed drones. Their vessel crashed, and they were the only survivors. The were seperated from the rest of the collective, and are now remembering who they were.</p>

<p>Back in the future, they’re trying to do SOMETHING to Seven as she sleeps. But are caught, and captured. But it’s pretty clear they’re not like, violent or evil in any way. They want to seperate the link between the three of them, as they are now seperate from the Borg fully not not each other. You’ve got three of them. The leader, some older guy, a Bajoran, and what looks like a stereotypical thug from a bad cyberpunk movie. Seven agrees to help them, but she’s concerned. She cannot remember what happened on the planet.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/LQw5BJk.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They need to link Seven back up to the mini collective here to try and help them. There’s a chance she may get locked in the collective with them, turning it into a quartet, but she’s willing to do it. There’s a lot of stuff about family. They’re the closest thing she still has to family. Well, them, and Voyager. She has a moment with Naomi, telling her that she’s her family. It’s cute.</p>

<p>She hooks up, and we see more of what happened on that planet. They all became unique, their own people, but Seven was scared cause it’s basically all she knows. She ends up being the one who linked them all together, in fear of what would happen. When they find out Seven is the reason, they freak out and get pissed off, then go into neural shock.</p>

<p>The Doctor now announces they have a new problem. They’ll die like this. They can sever the link but they’ll live for a month. Or they could be returned to the Borg and live normal length lives, as drones. They also can’t be spoken to for their opinions.</p>

<p>It’s pretty clear what they’d want. They will happily live out shorter lives, as themselves, and Seven helps them with that. They accept Seven and don’t hold a grudge against her, wishing her well. Two of them leave to live out their days. But the Bajoran… stays on Voyager! She was Starfleet, and is happy to stay on Voyager, but she’s not able to forgive Seven. Things are tense, but she understands WHY Seven did it. She was a scared girl.</p>

<p>Seven spends some time with Naomi, her family. It’s a cute ending. Pretty good episode, good season premiere!</p>

<p><strong>Barge of the Dead</strong> - VOY
6/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/sj9PaNX.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Torres is trying a shuttle and crashes into the hangar bay, but she’s alive. Her hair is also all frizzy and curly! It’s cute. She risked her life to get a probe, but everyone is like “you are far more important than a probe. We care about you”. And she doesn’t try to bit their heads off!</p>

<p>Chokie shows her a thing that was lodged in her port nacelle. A shard of something Klingon. Some hunk of metal with the Klingon insignia on it, hundreds of years old. Neat. He gives it to her, and then it starts bleeding and screaming. That’s probably normal. It IS Klingon in origin.</p>

<p>She asks for scans of it, and they do, but find nothing. She orders more scans and Kim seems done with this shit. Usually I hate when people are like “come on you didn’t see the thign you saw, that’s wild” on Trek because Trek is finding new weird shit all the time. But in this instance, honestly I’m surprised Kim isn’t MORE done with everything. My mans gotta be exhausted.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/nB4oHEi.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>At Tuvok’s weekly therapy, which is a thing Torres is doing now, he talks to her about her self hatred. She’s like “the hell are you talking about”. He then pulls out a batleth, wounds her, and tells her to leave, her and her dishonor. What the fuck</p>

<p>Neelix throws a party, a big Klingon inspired party. It’s partly cause they found that artifact, but also because it’s a piece of the Alpha quadrant so it’s a piece of home. She walks into the mess hall as they’re singing Klingon songs. It’s like a bunch of white people throwing a Diwali festival and the one Indian person walking in like “huh”. Anyways they celebrate, and then some Klingons come and murder everyone. Well then. Torres awakens on a bloody ship.</p>

<p>Turns out she’s on the Barge of the Dead. She’s dead. BEEN dead, in fact, and she’s being taken to Gre’thor, Klingon Hell. They just wanted to do a Klingon episode, and can you blame them?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/QaKw9NJ.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They explain that she’s been in The Dream, something dying brains make up to think they’re still alive. The murderer was just waking her up. They can’t brand her though, apparently it is “still not her time”. She tries to fight the ferryman, Kortar, the First Klingon, and gets injured instead. And then her mother showsu p as another member of the dishonored dead, and suddenly she’s awoken in med bay. Apparently she almost died in that shuttle and was in a coma.</p>

<p>She’s now stuck on the memory of seeing her mother going to Hell, possibly for her sins and dishonor. She doesn’t believe in the afterlife, but a part of her still does, and she’s wondering, what if? This is a good “what’s real and whats not” episode.</p>

<p>She studies the Ancient Texts, and finds two things. One, her dishonor can in fact cause her mom to go to hell, cause of “the sins of the child”. Remember, Klingon Culture is fucked up and bad. And two, when people return from the dead, they have wounds that they got there come back. And she did keep the wounds given to her in the fight.</p>

<p>Torres is basically a born again Klingon. She has a plan. She’s going to simulate a near death experience and go back to the barge to try and bargain for her mother’s honor. Everyone is kind of belligerent about it.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/MXjmTq9.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Torres is really hot here.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/1ukH8tE.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>It works though. She finds herself back on the barge. She goes to find her mother, who’s kind of a bitch? Absolutely awful. She also refuses, she doesn’t WANT her to do this. “Cheat” her way into Sto-vo-kor. But in the moment, Torres ACTUALLY takes her place, and agrees to actually die. What’s her personal hell? Voyager. It’s just Klingonized Voyager. But no, actually she’s still on the Barge. No, she’s dying in the Med Bay. No, she’s on the Barge, arguing with her mother again, who is actually NOT in Sto-vo-kor, and refuses to tell her what she’s “supposed” to do, she has to find out herself.  What she’s “supposed” to be.</p>

<p>I’ll be honest, I also don’t know what she’s supposed to be. I don’t get this episode. I don’t follow the themes or what’s going on, exactly, but she throws away the Batleth while crying, and apparently that’s the right decision? Her mom says she’ll get into Sto-vo-kor. Maybe she’s just having an identity crisis and is suffering from a bad nightmare? I honestly have no fucking idea. Anyways she wakes up and is all good, and hugs Janeway first before her fucking boyfriend I guess. I have no idea.</p>

<p><strong>Tinker Tenor Doctor Spy</strong> - VOY
10/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/inhp8ll.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This might be the weirdest cold open in all of Star Trek. The Doctor is singing to a crowd, Tuvok has Ponfar, and the Doctor starts singing about him having Ponfar and needing a hypospray. He calms Tuvok down with it and ends his song to rapturous applause. We return to the REAL world to find out that the Doctor has invented a way for himself to daydream.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/PTCcb3Z.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Doctor why are you fantasizing about knocking out a horny Tuvok?</p>

<p>The doctor sends an official message to the Captain that he’s not being treated well enough by the crew, and that he wants a promotion, basically. She’s like “what the fuck” but hey, might as well draft a response. Meanwhile an alien ship is watching and scanning voyager.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/sOLUAhe.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They are the Onlookers, of the Hierarchy. They just spy on people and learn more about them so they can raid for supplies. Okay, sure. They view Voyager as an unacceptable risk, though. But one of them thinks they can hack into the computer to study them better. And it works! They get a live feed! But it’s a feed of… the doctor’s daydreaming. Oh my god what a FUNNY idea.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the doctor suggests for his promotion that he be given additional backup programming as a commander to help command when needed. The ECH: The Emergency Command Hologram. Janeway finds it interesting, but pushes it down the line, cause it’d be too much hassle for now. But that doesn’t mean he can’t be the hero commander in his own mind!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/qWNLbL4.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This is all very exciting as he blows up a Borg Sphere by himself. The Onlookers are STUNNED, and are planning a raid, but only when he’s NOT in command. After all, the ship has riches upon riches inside!</p>

<p>The Doctor is walking down the hall, and is accosted by Chakotay, who congratulates him on blowing up the Borg. He’s confounded. Chakotay is in his quarters… uh oh. The daydreaming program is going off at all times. He tries to eject the core IRL, and they have to hold him back. They lock him in sick bay, but also hook him up to the holodeck so they can watch them. Everyone is excited, but Janeway is kinda disturbed. I mean, she promised him she’s treat him like any other member of the crew, and this is intruding.</p>

<p>Parts of this remind me of the first Barclay episode, but I like this a lot more. Some of the fantasies he has are a bit uncomfy, like romance fantasies, but like… a lot of us DO have those. We get it. He’d never act on them. Janeway sees one last fantasy where he’s so proud to be given the ECH program, because all he wants to do is reach his potential and help the people he loves. She feels a way about it.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/BzAfzqc.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The daydreams are fixed, but then they show back up. But it’s actually the Onlooker. His name is Phlox. He’s realized that what he’s been watching is NOT reality. And if his superior find out, he’ll be fired, or worse. He also wants to protect Voyager and the Doctor, because he’s formed a parasocial relationship over the past few days. I get it. I like the Doctor too. He offers to help them, but only if he ALSO pretends to actually be in command, so he doesn’t get fired. Oh boy.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Tx1t43y.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>What commences is the ultimate bluff. The Doctor, anxious as fuck, talking to the Hierarchy leader, who demands surrender. The Hierarch actually could EASILY destroy Voyager, and take what they want, buuuut the Doctor has a secret weapon. The Photonic Cannon. A super weapon he built that blew up the Borg Sphere. And he WILL turn it on them. So they run the fuck away cause holy shit, they don’t wanna deal with THAT</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/cPwF5ka.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The Doctor is given a promotion for his valor, and he will be given the ECH program after all. Wonderful, extremely enjoyable episode. I liked the Onlookers, they felt like Pacleds You Don’t Hate, and I love aliens learning about humanity from fiction. It was a combination of the Pacled episode and the Barclay episode, and it was way better than both.</p>

<p><strong>Alice</strong> - VOY
7/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/kTF1XF9.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Voyager is flying around when it detects a flotilla in front of them. Friendly or violent? Well, they get a hail, aaand it’s a junkyard. Abaddon’s Repository of Lost Treasures. They beam him on board, and he’s very interested to trade. He doesn’t have TOO much they need, but Paris sees a ship that looks VERY interesting. It has a “Neurogenic Interface”, which means it connects to the pilot through the brain, so you can control it directly. Seems weird, but sure. It needs a bit of fixing up! Good thing Kim is willing to help fix it up! “I am?”</p>

<p>Abaddon is sad to see it go, but is absolutely willing to trade. Paris names the new ship “Alice”, after a girl he had a crush on once at the Acadamy. He connects to it, but blows out some power relays and goes to bed. And theeen he hears voices in his head calling to him, calling him to the bay. Who is that? “It’s me, Alice”</p>

<p><em>cocks gun</em> ships haunted.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/svLwfyn.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We get a montage of Paris fixing it up. He starts wearing a flight suit he found in her database. He gets REAL into it, missing hang outs with Kim. Stops shaving. Belanna and him have a date on there and she’s kinda weirded out by how he’s being. Aaaand then she starts manifesting as a thing he can see.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/LEm4rhT.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This is Alice. She has Overly Attached Girlfriend Eyes, she reminds me of Gifanny from Gravity Falls. She keeps wanting to leave and go elsewhere with him, tried to convince him to leave Voyager over and over. Also it seems like connecting with her is kind of… addicting? Brain washing? Bimbofying? One of those.</p>

<p>Everyone is watching Tom kinda become… less himself, and more distant as he’s working on this ship. It’s uncomfortable and kinda sad. He’s not SO far gone that he doesn’t at least try to save Torres when the ship literally tries to kill her.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/sX0gkAX.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Paris at least realizes things are bad and tries to go to sickbay to get free of her influence, but it doesn’t go well. Alice causes him pain in his brain to force him to go back to the ship and fly away. He connects to the ship directly and they become “One”. It’s creepy. This entire episode is creepy. In a pretty entertaining way.</p>

<p>Paris and Alice manage to fly away. Voyager goes back to Abaddon to try and figure out what’s going on. He’s connected to Alice too, who tries to kill him for telling them anything. “I DID WHAT YOU ASKED I GOT YOU A PILOT-“ yeah, she’s nuts. They manage to save her, who tells them what we basically already know. She’s nuts, and wanted a pilot, for some reason. They find out where she’s going on scanners, a “Particle Fountain”, a kind of anomaly they know little about, because it ends up killing anyone who gets near it. Alice calls it “home”.</p>

<p>So either she’s an alien intelligence to some other universe, or she’s malfunctioning. Either way, Paris is probably dead. They can’t fire on the ship either, because he’s one with it, so hurting the ship will hurt him too. They need to shut down the ship by hacking it, while distracting Alice and Paris. So they hack into his neurogenic interface and hook Torres in there.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/XHzbPwN.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>There’s a Battle in the Mind, and he’s teleported out, just before Alice explodes. I guess she… got what she wanted? To explode in an anomaly???</p>

<p>Paris is extremely upset that he ever let it get that bad. “It was like I was sleepwalking. Thanks for being my alarm clock”. How romantic?? She also promises no more affairs with strange ships. But don’t worry about the Delta Flyer, they’re just friends.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="Voyager" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 143</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/05/11/OOCY143.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 143" /><published>2025-05-11T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-05-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/05/11/OOCY143</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/05/11/OOCY143.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Etb1XfR.png" alt="Two girls on a train.

<p>Final Fantasy 8 is a very special game that I had never played, once, in my entire life. I own it, though. It fascinated me, so I picked it up hoping to get to it, but it took me probably about 13 years. This is a special one in the Final Fantasy Ouvre, because it’s extremely divisive. There are a lot of people who love it, consider it their favorite in the entire series. There’s also a lot of people who haaate it. It’s a bit of a blacksheep, the one to skip. As I play games on stream, I also read contemporary reviews of games, and there were some scaaathing ones for this one. When I was an impressionable younger kid, reading those reviews but not playing the game, I agreed with them. This game is the worst in the series, I said, until 13 came out and I played that. Then it was the 2nd worst. But now I played it. I have formed my own opinions. And my thoughts?</p>

<p>I think I like Final Fantasy 8 more than 7.</p>

<p>With THAT controversial take out of the way, let’s get right into it!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/v25cEbE.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Final Fantasy 8 is a very ambitious video game. It’s unique in Final Fantasy in many, many ways, all of which I will try to get to. Unique doesn’t neccesarily mean good, but you can respect the effort for a lot of them. There are a LOT of things to get to that FF8 does differently from both its immediate predecessor, and every other game in the series, but I think the first thing I want to talk about is mechanics.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy 8 introduces the Junction System. So, in universe, there are these things called GFs. Guardian Forces, I think, but we just kept calling them girlfriends, because it made for some very, VERY funny moments, like when the final boss exclaimed that they were using the MOST POWERFUL GIRLFRIEND. In game terms, this is a summon, essentially. These summons have their own levels and stats that they gain alongside you, and you “junction”, or equip, them to a character. The game has no other equipment aside from that, except for a minor weapon system that is less buying weapons and more crafting upgrades to them.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/95QiDn1.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Each girlfriend also has their own abilities they can learn. These are things like stuff to help when they’re summoned, active abilities like Mug or Darkside, Cecil’s power from FF4. Passive abilities, like Encnone, allowing you to bypass all random encounters. Stat abilities, boosting stats or letting you gain stats when you level up, WE’LL GET TO IT. And finally, most importantly, magic junction abilities. These are ones called like “Mag”, or “Vit”. These will allow you to junction magic to a character in that stat if they have this GF junctioned. So, you equip the GF as armor basically, giving abilities, but also the ability to equip more things to increase stats. Make sense? You can equip magic you get onto these stats, increasing them based on the magic you choose, and the amount. Some magic is better for stats than others. Life and Cure spells are good for health and defense stats, while big damage spells like Flare and Meteor are good for Strength and MAgic.</p>

<p>How do you GET these spells though? Well, that’s where the Draw system comes into play. Each enemy has some spells that they have equipped. You can then select the Draw ability, which is equipped via GF like any other ability, and you can draw those spells from that enemy to your personal stash. You can ALSO just up and cast them, good in a pinch, but they’re weaker this way. The amount drawn depends on your magic stat, from 1 to 9. This means on average, with a cap of 100, you will be drawing about 20 times for one spell, but more than likely only 11. This can be tedious sounding, and it kinda is, but it’s extremely important to be able to do anything.</p>

<p>You may be going, wow Liz, this sounds confusing. And it kinda is! This is the biggest hurdle to getting into FF8, because this system is REQUIRED to do ANYTHING. FF8 doesn’t increase your stats as you level up as much as most FF games do, and it doesn’t matter too, because as you level up, so do enemies. You need to constantly be swapping out Junctions as you progress with better spells, so you can keep up. And when you get to points where you need to swap characters, it gets VERY clunky. This system is, straight up, jank. Not to mention that it disincentivizes using magic, as it’ll lower your stats. But it’s also kinda fun?</p>

<p>It makes it kinda like FF7 where any character can be anything. You have base stats, but then you can fit them however you want. This is cool, and really fun to break. But if you dunno what you’re doing, it’s kinda frustrating. And even if you DO know what you’re doing, the clunkiness can get to you. Over all I felt it was a plus, though, and I respected them trying something new with this system.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/QFXsdAC.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>I should also mention with the gameplay is the limit break system. In FF6, limit breaks happened randomly when you were low on health. They took that system and changed it completely for FF7, giving you a bar and once it filled up, forcing you to limit break. FF8 returns to the FF6 format. The more fucked up your character is, the higher a chance of their limit break happening, and the better it is. Lower health, more status effects. These use no magic, and aren’t super long winded, though they are y’know, long unskippable cutscenes, they’re not at bad as the summons, which I’ll get to. This is, by far, the best way to deal damage. But this also means you need to try and stay hovering at low health for a lot of fights to get em done faster, which is hectic.</p>

<p>I also wanna talk about the summons. A lot of reviews I read said that the best and only way to fight enemies, cause normal combat is so weak and slow paced, is to just spam summons. But summons have like, minute long summoning cutscenes. There’s no real reason NOT to use them, they’re just slow. You choose to summon one, then you have like, a backwards ATB meter that counts down, and a Summon health bar. If that health bar goes down, the summon doesn’t come out. Then you watch a long-ass cutscene, and then they deal like, okay damage. No cost, nothing. Now, I used summons maybe four times in the entire game. Once to see what they were like, twice for an actual effect (doom train reduces enemy defense), and once to see what the final summons animation was. It’s 30 seconds longer than Knights of the Round in FF7 and is absolutely fucking nuts.</p>

<p>The summon system feels unneccesary and not super great, and I dunno what all those magazines were whining about. I think they just didn’t get the Junction system and weren’t playing very well.</p>

<p>ONE LAST gameplay thing, and that’s mini games. So, Final Fantasy games love their little minigames. Small gameplay things that don’t make any sense and barely fit into the world. FF7 had so fucking many of them. You snowboarded down a slope after burying your dead friend. Does FF8 have anything like that? Well, only one, but it’s built into the entire game, and that’s Triple Triad. It’s a pretty fun and well made card game, I like Triple Triad. And you can abuse those cards you win by modding them into good magic and items, which is cool as hell. If you wanna min-max like crazy, you are going to be VERY familiar with Triple Triad. I just got all the cards. It was a lot of card games.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/qyzcf59.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Next, let’s talk character and story. The main character of our game is Squall Leonhart. All my life, I heard the following. “It’s kinda public opinion that Cloud is an emotionless emo boy, but that’s not true. SQUALL is that, not Cloud”. I’ve now played this game and once again, much like Cloud, I feel like people only look at the surface and the first 10 minutes and decide that’s just what Squall is for the entire game. Now I’m curious to finish FF13 and find out if Lightning actually grows as a character.</p>

<p>Squall is a dork. He’s an anti-social teenager who responds “whatever” to things, but he’s actually just a fucking dork. It doesn’t help that we made his personality “extremely not into anything anyone else is doing, unless it fits his interests, which is card games” as a joke. He’s bad at communication, but is thrust into a leadership position rather suddenly, which he didn’t seem to want or care that much about. But he’s not emo, and he’s not emotionless, and he’s not a bad character at all. And by the end as you see him evolve, it’s great. In the final cutscene he calls out for his friends to help him. That feels like a minor thing, but that’s the culmination of his character development, it’s wonderful.</p>

<p>Squall is a child mercenary working for SeeD. SeeD is a special class of mercenary, trained by the three Gardens in the world. He’s joined by his fellow mercenaries from his garden, Quistis, one of the teachers who’s also a SeeD, his classmate Zell, a meathead who has Tifa’s moveset. They also meet Selphie, a slightly unhinged airhead from another Garden, and Irvine, the rootin’ tootin’ playboy cowboy from the last Garden, who’s actually extremely insecure and anxious about everything. It’s a good cast. But of course, we’re missing one more major character.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/cZqtOt0.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>This is Rinoa, the plucky but kind of in-over-her-head leader of an underground resistance group fighting against The Evil Empire. She hires Squall and his group to help her fight against the Empire, and that’s one of the big things this game does differently to most other Final Fantasy games. This game IS about typical final fantasy stuff, fighting evil empires and stopping a world ending calamity. But at its core, it’s a love story. It’s about romance between Squall and Rinoa. And at first I was like “These two? Yeah right”. And it felt a little forced and heavy handed. But honestly? By the scene where they’re dying in space, stranded in space suits (yes really), I REALLY felt it. It was good. And Rinoai s a really cute character. She kinda looks like someone wanted to just make Tifa again, but has mild prosopagnosia, but that’s fine. Character wise she’s cute. Also her limit breaks use her dog Angelo! Angelo no joke has the most broken limit breaks, and he saved the galaxy by defeating the final boss with his “make everyone invincible for a minute” ability.</p>

<p>The villain is interesting too, as a comparison to Sephiroth. I really didn’t care for Sephiroth very much. Didn’t find him interesting, and he basically wasn’t in 80% of the game. Our villain here is a fun contrast cause she’s also kinda like that. Kinda. But not. See, the villain Ultimecia feels like a late game reveal of “this is the bad guy all along”, but her fingers and influence has been felt for the entire game in a way I appreciate. The final dungeon is Kinda Fucked, but over all I liked her presence. And she’s got a great final boss. Halfway through the game you name Squall’s lion he has on his ring, and I named it “Liony the Lion” as a joke. Anyways Liony the Lion became the final boss and it fucking floored me.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Os22yA9.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Next let’s talk graphics. This game looks STUNNINGLY good for 1999 PS1. Like, yes, parts of it are chunky and look rough, like “best looking guy here” Squall up there. But over all, the in game graphics are quite good, and they move into FMV in a really seamless way that blew my mind multiple times with super cool sequences. And speaking of which, that FMV?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/heDfX8Y.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Really godo for the 90s. You can see some parts where it looks weird, or unnatural, but over all, it genuinely looks fantastic, and blew me away almost every time. Aesthetically, this game is on point. It’s also unique aesthetically. FF7 kinda mixed fantasy and sci-fi, but this is FULL on sci-fi, and it looks cool as hell.</p>

<p>The music is also really good. Not as good as FF7, I think, over all. But it’s got lots of great tracks. That final boss theme, The Extreme? Holy moly. Here’s the theme, by the way. It’s great cause it’s a surprise final boss phase after what seems like it was the last one, so it’s calm and peaceful as you’re like “Phew, it’s finally over”. AND THEN IT FUCKING KICKS IN. Head bangs the entire time.</p>

<p>One of those contemporary reviews I read about this game claimed that FF8 had the worst soundtrack of the entire series, and that it was a travesty, with no good songs at all. Look, no FF game has a bad soundtrack. Some have less standouts than others. But you cannot tell me the game with THIS SONG</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/orKgvGz2dHs?si=tX7aRK6mOOPtw_BQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>is the worst Final Fantasy soundtrack out there. FF4’s soundtrack is way, way more boring. FF4 does not have a Shuffle or Boogie.</p>

<p>Anyways yeah, don’t have much more to add. I think FF8 is clunky, and kind of a mess, but in a way that I GREATLY enjoyed and had a lot of fun with. It’s a mixed bag, but I understand what people see in it now.</p>

<p>Really excited to play 9, because I know SO little about 9 over all.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="PS1" /><category term="retro games" /><category term="Final Fantasy" /><category term="RPGs" /><category term="Reviews" /><category term="Unmastered" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Yuri Recommendation - Ouji-sama Nante Iranai</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/05/10/OOCYSuggestion.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Yuri Recommendation - Ouji-sama Nante Iranai" /><published>2025-05-10T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-05-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/05/10/OOCYSuggestion</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2025/05/10/OOCYSuggestion.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/W3XYZqk.png" alt="Two women looking at each other in a very straight way." class="center-block" /></p>

<p>So I’ve been recently staying up till 3AM reading this manga, it’s called Ouji-sama Nante Iranai, and I finished it last night, so I wanted to talk about it. I don’t do recommendations as much as I should, so here, here’s one</p>

<p>Ouji-sama Nante Iranai is the story of two highschool students, Yukino and Nobara. They are 1st year students at this fancy school that has a weird gimmick. It has two divisions. See, it’s a school for both super fancy rich girls, and also hard working scholarship girls. These are the Botan and the Shakuyaku, respectively. Many years ago, this division was basically because the Shakuyaku were the Botan’s lackeys and personal servants, but at some point a Shakuyaku was elected to be student president, and managed to give the Shakuyaku more freedoms and rights in the school. But this ALSO means that the relationship between the two divisions is… bad. Lots of infighting, lots of catty bullshit.</p>

<p>But there’s two students here. Yukino, and Nobara. Yukino is Shakuyaku, Nobara is Botan. Yukino comes from an “ordinary” family, Nobara’s parents are wealthy musicians. Makes sense. In a normal setting, these two would never meet or come together, and even in this setting, they wouldn’t neccesarily get along, considering the bad vibes. But on the first day, Yukino meets Nobara in the greenhouse, and is entranced by how beautiful she is. But like, in a straight way, you know.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/9OeOpcZ.png" alt="Nobara sleeping in the greenhouse" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Not only that, but due to a mixup, Yukino has to room with Nobara in the Botan dorms. Luckily, Yukino is a sweet young girl who just wnats to make people happy, and Nobara is a kind of emotionless doll who doesn’t really mind. They find each other fascinating, and what grows from their new friendship is something quite beautiful.</p>

<p>This story is, at its heart, the story of these two girls as they grow closer. Y’know, yuri. And it’s not like that “oh pure friendship between girls” kinda yuri, though the comic does address that at places, no, it’s pretty explicit. But not just that, but it’s about the political movings of this small school, the many students that inhabit it, and all of their personal relations. A school filled with students that hate each other slowly starts to come together, and it starts with Nobara and Yukino’s blossoming friendship.</p>

<p>This story has a lot of characters. Like, a loooot. And each of them has in depth backstories and character and motivations. Very minor characters who you wouldn’t expect get serious moments about who they love and who they want to be with. Like, for example, Yukino has a best friend from her old school. That best friend has a roomate, the ace of the school’s drama club. Okay, so she’s a minor character, but she gets a lot of indepth story is what you’re saying? Yes. But it’s more than that. We see this girl meet another girl and fall in love, but also at the same time, we get minor characters through THEIR connections. Later on there’s a school dance and they’re put into pairs, and the drama prince gets assigned a Botan who we’ve seen a few times as a background character. And she starts getting a crush, and suddenly it grows out from THERE. There’s a major love triangle between three minor characters. There’s a lot of things like this. You get like, 4 chapters for every minor character, showing their struggles and problems, with Nobara or Yukino (or both) helping them through it, as the school comes closer together.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Eg8oTBU.png" alt="Yukino waking Nobara up" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>At the center of it, though, there’s Yukino and Nobara. And it’s a cute sweet story. I like their characters. Yukino is a sweetheart who has MAJOR self worth problems, because she kind of tends to base her self worth on helping others and how much others like her. And Nobara is still suffering from the death of her parents a few years ago, which she blames herself for, and has walled herself off from the world. We watch them help each other through their problems and grow as people, it’s really heartwarming.</p>

<p>This is a rather long manga. 200 chapters. It’s in a long strip format, so it’s a LOT of reading. It took me several nights to finish, but I’m glad I did, it was really enjoyable, and I highly recommend it. If you like school drama, character drama, and of course social gap drama, you’ll like this one.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="oocy" /><category term="yuri" /><category term="Ouji-sama Nante Iranai" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Retro Achievement Mastery 173 - Winnie the Pooh in the Hundred Acre Wood</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/05/06/RA174-Pooh.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Retro Achievement Mastery 173 - Winnie the Pooh in the Hundred Acre Wood" /><published>2025-05-06T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-05-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/05/06/RA174-Pooh</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2025/05/06/RA174-Pooh.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/j5iduki.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Sierra On-Line was maybe THE Apple II dev. They made a lot of the most popular adventure games of the day, many of which you probably still know about, despite coming out almost 40 years ago. Games like King’s Quest, Space Quest, Police Quest, Leisure Suit Larry, Quest for Glory, Phantasmagoria, the list goes on. They were very, VERY big at the time. And around the growing height of their fame, in the mid 80s on their home town of the Apple II, they also made this.</p>

<p>It’s a simple text adventure with graphical components, mostly just a solid unmoving image. You move around a grid of a map, and sometimes into spaces on those grids like houses, in order to find items that are scattered around the Hundred Acre Wood. You then need to bring those items to their owners, who are scattered around, mostly in their houses. You are not Pooh in this, you’re just some random kid. There’s lots of spaces to explore, and every now and then the items move aroumd. They start randomized, and there’s a large pool of them but only 10 show up, so it’s technically different every time!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/DcahVU5.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>For an Apple II game, I have to give credit, this LOOKS good. Compare this to a lot of the other games like this, text adventures which have an image at the top of where you are, and it’s night and day. I can actually recognize Owl!! They clearly put actual effort into the art, which is not a surprise since they probably had Disney breathing down their necks, and Disney will NOT let you do off-model art.</p>

<p>Over all, this is a very simple but kind of cute kids adventure game, where the adventure is mostly wandering aimlessly and occasionally running into a character you like. I was a HUGE Winnie the Pooh fan as a kid, so I had some sense of whimsy playing this, but there’s not a whole lot to it. There’s a reason that despite Sierra On-Line being one of the biggest game companies of the time, I could find very, very little about this game online. Sierra has a lot of great games I wanna check out sometime, and a wonderful history that was sadly cut short in the late 90s when it was bought by some big-ass firm that fell apart quickly, like all those big ass firms that buy companies do. It then lost all its talent and became a shadow until finally being devoured by Activision, because capitalism is garbage. But at least we can still look back on its classics, like <em>looks at notes</em> Winnie the Pooh.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Apple" /><category term="Obscure games" /><category term="Winnie the Pooh" /><category term="Text Adventures" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sierra On-Line was maybe THE Apple II dev.
