<p>Another game that feels less retro and more modern based on its genre and concept, Rock On! Island is a tower defense game from 1987. This genre basically wasn’t a thing until the early 2000s with flash games. But hey, whatever works, I’m here to review the games, not anochronistic issues.</p>

<p>Rock On! Island follows you as Ug, the young chief of a group of cavepeople, who are being attacked by dinosaurs, who are trying to wipe you out for good. Humans and dinosaurs got along for years, but now the Four Emperors have taken over and are trying to take the island for themselves! You must lead your people through wit and cunning to keep your caves safe.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/9bAeN31.png" alt="ROI" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>It is, as I said, a tower defense. You have waves, and inbetween the waves you can set up cavemen to protect the lane leading to your cave. These cavemen can be upgrades to different forms: fire, spear, and rock. Then again, to fire 2, tar, spear 2, bow, rock 2, and wheel. Most of these can honestly be ignored, bow is what you need. Bow is EXTREMELY OP, and can carry you. But I’ll get to balance issues later. You can also buy chickens, which help increase the meat you get each turn, and can be cooked with fires to give a 3x price increase. Those fires can ALSO upgrade cavemen near them, so it’s about balancing and placing defenses, and economy. You can ALSO upgrade Ug, who has a stone axe, and you can increase the speed and power. On some stages, a fully upgraded Ug can straight up carry the entire stage by herself. She doesn’t even need cavemen, she’s EXTREMELY strong. Don’t get hit though, you’ll respawn after a few seconds and lose some health. Lose all the health, and that’s it, game over.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/0N0KS19.png" alt="ROI" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Okay, issues. This game has balance issues. The bow is OP, as I said, but all of the stages go the following way: The first 2/5ths of the stage are slow, shakey, and awkward, and you will lose constantly, or just BARELY not lose, if you’re trying to do it without taking any damage, which you are, cause that’s the good ending for the cherry. After that, after you have a bit of a starting defense, the game is piss easy and you barely have to pay attention. Repeat that for ten levels.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/op4aRcQ.png" alt="ROI" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>It’s FINE, but it’s really missing something to take it over the top. Also the lack of music in the planning stage is unfortunate.</p>

<p>I have nothing more to add, except for this little bit you can find in one of the side areas. Some animals have broken off to form a peaceful contingency, and this is what one of them says:</p>

<p>Vainger is one of those games that, when you see it, and you see the scope and what it is they’re actually trying here, you go “ohhh shit”. Cause this is a metroidvania, and yes, we’ve had those already, sure. But it’s REALLY a metroidvania. It’s UFO Soft’s Metroid.</p>

<p>In Vainger you play as a doctor who is tied to a robot combat suit, the Vainger. You re-awaken after an incident to find that the station you work at has become overrun, and that you were betrayed. Now you must explore the station, piece together the story from logs, collect items to travel deeper, and defeat the evil at the core of the station.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/oubqAwE.png" alt="Vainger" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>The best way I can describe Vainger is it’s Metal Storm meets Metroid. Metroid Storm. You run and gun and jump, with crouching included even, and then you can ALSO flip gravity so you run and jump on the ceiling. It’s extremely fun and fluid, and a lot of the gameplay and challenge comes from well timed flips to platform in tricky ways.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/12dsXL6.png" alt="Vainger" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Now, it IS a metroidvania, but it’s actually rather small, IMO. Porgy is maybe as small, but with Porgy, you travel much slower, and have to travel back over and over to the surface. In Vainger, there’s no such mechanic, so you can cover the entire station in only a few minutes. You could easily 100% this game in an hour and change. And in fact, I had to. This game has a glitch where it can eat your fucking power ups, which it did to me :) So I had to 100% it, again. This was very, very annoying, and honestly, I haven’t really forgiven it yet.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/jtNQ640.png" alt="Vainger" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Another thing about Vainger is its powerup system. You find powers which allow you to explore deeper, like any Metroidvania, but then you must equip them to your grav system, your body, or your gun, each of which do different things. Having your items in different spots for different situations is important, and you need to backtrack sometimes to a save station to equip the right combo.</p>

<p>Vainger isn’t hard or anything, and while I’m very annoyed by it, I cannot deny it’s an extremely good metroidvania. It’s creative and cool and fun.</p>

<p>…now for some meta story. The buyout is fully complete, Gerry and his nephew Boby have left the company, and the rest of the team have to pick up the pieces and continue on. But it can’t be too hard, can it? …We’re already seeing some struggling. This game almost got cancelled due to arguments and problems within the company. Namely with its director, Chiffon Bola, who has been butting heads with the new management, especially Ian Spinzer, the new middle manager in the office. And them moving offices to a giant office across town isn’t helping. They’re a small team, they don’t NEED this giant new space, and the old space had so many memories. Now they’re seperated from the fun center, the burger joints. They’re seperated, and a bit isolated.</p>

<p>You can see Bola’s frustration with the situation as an easter egg in a hidden room in Vainger: Here’s a message, which makes no god damn sense…. unless you know who Ian Spinzer is.</p>

<p>Lots to talk about with the backstory for this one. Rail Heist is the first game with credits since Tao Nemuru bought the company and became CEO and producer, and since Gerry Smolski left the company in the power struggle. In the credits of this game we see Tao Nemuru as producer, and the manager he brought into the company, Ian Spinzer. We now have middle management in the mix! Ian Spinzer will become someone VERY important to the story, but for now, we just know he’s middle management. Most of that doesn’t matter for this game, though. Rail Heist was already being made before the buyout even happened, so they didn’t have much of an effect on the creation of this game. Which might explain why it fucking kicks ass.</p>

<p>Taking place in the world of Lonestar, this game is the game that takes place, I BELIEVE, as a far flung sequel to the world in Devilition. There’s one other game that’ll take place here, Grimstone, which started production before Rail Heist but won’t come out for another year. So what is Rail Heist about?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/jfq5pvu.png" alt="Divers" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>In Rail Heist, you play three train robbers, led by Gran, an ol’ bank robber who’s retired by this point, but is still your guide, cause she knows this bidness better than anyone. This is a kind of… turn based action puzzle platformer? Your character is placed on this train, and you need to use the environment to your advantage. Once the lawmen are wary of your presence, they will begin patrolling, and now you only have 8 seconds before it swaps to their turn, where they move around, and if they see you, they’ll just fucking shoot you. If they see you, at ALL, they will fucking shoot you. The lawmen of this world have VERY twitchy fingers. You CAN use this to their advantage, throwing chickens to get them to unload their bullet and take a sec to reload, or have them shoot their fucking buddies. This game is PERFECT in its representation of how awful cops are at their jobs.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/z0P4nd1.png" alt="Divers" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>You can use the environment to your advantage, hiding in barrels, throwing boxes, punching lawmen off trains, breaking the floor from under them and having them fall to their deaths. Sound isn’t a thing here, only if they have DIRECT eye sight with you will they know you’re there, so if you’re like, just above them, nope. They got laser eyes. But if you have your gun out, you ALSO have overwatch. Use THAT to your advantage!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/2Ys3SkT.png" alt="Divers" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>This game is utter clownshoes, and is one of the most fun things I’ve played in ages. While the levels ARE always the same, things fall out of hand very, VERY quickly, and when you die you fucking bounce all over the god damn place between enemy bullets, or go SPLAT on the rail tracks, it’s so funny. It feels really rewarding and fun to FINALLY conquer a level. You can also get three medals on each level, one for killing all lawmen, one for beating a pre-set time, and one for killing no lawmen. It’s real fun learning each level and developing a route through each.</p>

<p>This is one of my personal favorite games in the collection, 4th place. Highly recommended.</p>

<p>I FUCKING love this game.</p>

<p>All that stuff about Nemuru and Smolski and the politics of the office, throw that out the window for this one. We have no idea who made this game. There are no credits. I can guess, though. You can find mooncat and Barbuta in here, and the game’s energy and vibe are…. deafening. And it’s one of the weirdest most creative fucking things I’ve played. I love this god damn game.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Kk5I4Fp.png" alt="Divers" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Divers is a game that makes no sense the second you open it up. You are IMMEDIATELY thrust in it, with three options, none labeled. Nothing about this game will be explained, so don’t bother. You’ve got a shop, and equip screen, and a button that I will just call “dive”. So you get your items, some sticks and lids, and equip your Bois. You’ve got three Bois: Dylan, Orlok, and Thyme. These three lizard men are a polycule, and they are your bois for the remainder of this game. 
Cherish them. Every day they dive into the murky depths in search of treasure, knowledge, and whatever the fuck it is they’re hunting for.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/MFIvqqd.png" alt="Divers" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>The best way I can describe this game is that it’s Dragon Quest 2 meets the TMNT Dam Level. I call it that and all the other sickos like me who love this go “oh yeah, that is kinda what this is”. You explore a big open map, diving deeper, trying to find anything in the murky darkness. You have a small radius around you that you can see, and you need to find treasure chests and other goodies in the deep, while either avoiding enemies that float around and try to chase you, or fight them.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/kc5v8gX.png" alt="Divers" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>When you do fight them, you’ll find the combat is very early NES RPG, very Dragon Quest 2. The items you equipped to your bois can be used a limited number of times, and you select them as you fight, either to hit the enemy, or to defend one of your boyfriends. The combat is pretty rough at first, this game is a big grind game. You are weak as fuck at first, and after almost every fight, you need to step back and flee to the safety of the light above, where your bois will eat and rest and return rejuvinated for the following day. Every time a boi falls, it says in full caps that they DIED, but like, it’s fine. Food and sleep cures all.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/CmC0z3a.png" alt="Divers" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Divers is large, and will take you over ten hours, most likely. You’ve got a large cavern system to explore and find secrets in. But by the end, I wanted more. I want a game that’s literally this but 3x as long, and I am not joking. The vibes of this game are immaculate. This game has one of my favorite OSTs in the entire pack, and 70% of the game is LITERALLY PLAYED IN SILENCE. Just the feeling and energy of the unsettling deep fills me with an emotion I cannot describe. I love this game. It is perfect in every way, and I absolutely cannot recommend it enough, but it is… a little difficult to get into. It’s a large undertaking, but if you like NES RPGs, you’ll probably adore this.</p>

<p>It’s also worth noting that somewhere in the depths is The Green Room, a giant room which is one of two rooms in the entire game where music plays, and there’s literally nothing in it. …Nothing that we’ve found. There might be a hidden boss, or meta progression, or it was a dummied out thing that was left in, we don’t know. But that music haunts me. I take naps to it :)</p>

<p>I felt like absolute garbage today, massive migraine day, so I decided to take the day off from doing anything actually important and I kinda just played games while watching Todd in the Shadows and videos about Archie Sonic. I decided to pick up and play this game, which I had played earlier this week on stream and decided after an hour that it was a “play by myself” kinda game. Because it’s kinda boring.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/p7dgwvB.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Arkista’s Ring is a 1990 NES game by NMK and published by American Sammy. NMK made a bunch of games that I have not heard of at all, though Wikipedia tells me their most popular one is Zed Blade for Neo Geo. Sure. I had never heard of this game, but recently I’d been wanting to play more NES stuff, cause I love my NES and I hadn’t explored some of the more obscure depths of it, or even the less obscure depths. I pulled up the NES games list on RA and noticed quite early on (in the As in fact, funny that) this game, Arkista’s Ring. I was immediately drawn in by the 80s as fuck anime elf girl. Hell yeah, elf girls. I’m on board, let’s go.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/dN6SCqh.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>It’s a top down action game that was compared to Zelda a lot on its release and I’ll be real I have no idea why because they have very little in common. They’re both top down games where you are and elf and you fight enemies that kinda walk around on a grid-base, but uh, that’s about it. Zelda is a big ass adventure where you explore and discover secrets. Arkista’s Ring is level based and very samey. You have an open area where you need to kill all enemies, and then a key spawns in a little stand thing, grab that, go through the door, boom next level. There are like 40 or so levels, and they’re all the same every time, there’s no randomization here. The enemies are deterministic based on your movement, so you can outsmart them pretty easily. You play as Christine, a cute little elf who’s trying to get back Arkista’s Ring, an Elven ring stolen by the evil Shogun that has caused shadows to fall over the land or some shit, typical fantasy stuff. The game can be split into three different parts, where you go into dungeons and fight a manticore, go into crypts and fight a vampire, and then go into the shogun’s castle and fight the shogun.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/dN6SCqh.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>There are a bunch of enemy types, that can kinda be split into a few different types. Enemies that wander and run into you, enemies that throw shit when you cross their line of sight, enemies that wave back and forth and fly over walls, and ninjas. Ninjas are the fucking worst. They’re basically just the enemies that run into you but they’re fast as shit, some have way too much health, and they can jump over walls. Literally, if you fight these things like normal, they will out damage you at full health. Thankfully you can sometimes cheese their wall jump to get them stuck.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Fh67ybC.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>If you press select at the start of a level, you get to see your character, and it’s laid out like an RPG’s stat sheet, as if Christine isn’t the only character you can play. Sex: Female. Yes please. Anyways, you also have loads of items and weapons you can pick up from enemies. You’ll get a full loadout by the end of the game… probably. Two items, the Elf Mirror and the Wealth Amulet are like, .5% drops, and even though this game is very long and you pick up a lot of items, I did 1.5 playthroughs of it and only found it on my third real attempt, on level 35. I played this game halfway through, gamed over, and had to start again. You DO get 10 continues, VERY generous, but the set required a 1cc so I started over. And this is a rough game for that. You need a route and plan to deal with those fucking ninjas, and though the game is short, kind of, it’s also long as fuck. You see, there are 31 levels, but after you beat the Shogun on level 31, the game loops. Oh so it’s endless? No. There is an end. After loop 4 the game goes “yo good job” and just ends on the character screen unceremoneously. So it DOES have an ending but you literally have to beat it all 4 times. It’s a bit of a slog. Put on a podcast like I did and veg out.</p>

<p>All in all, Arkista’s Ring isn’t anything special, but it does have an 80s anime elf girl, which is what I came to it for, I guess. It’s really not BAD, but there’s a reason it’s been kind of forgotten over the years.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="NES" /><category term="retro games" /><category term="obscure games" /><category term="Arkista&apos;s Ring" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Retro Achievement Mastery 114 - D</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2024/10/16/RA114-D.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Retro Achievement Mastery 114 - D" /><published>2024-10-16T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-10-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2024/10/16/RA114-D</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/ramastery/2024/10/16/RA114-D.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/r0kKugl.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Y’all want the D?</p>

<p>Thank you, thank you, that’s the kind of comedy you can expect here at my blog.</p>

<p>D is a 1995 first person point and clicky type horror game originally made for the 3DO and later ported to other consoles like the PS1 and the Saturn. I played the Saturn version, because of course I did. It was made by Warp and Kenji Eno, who was a bit of an eccentric creator. I’ll go into stories about him later cause they’re VERY funny, let’s talk about the game first.</p>

<p>The story follows a girl named Laura, who’s heard that her father, a reputable doctor, has snapped and barricaded himself in his hospital, killing everyone inside and keeping a few as hostages. She enters the hospital to try and stop him (I guess the police just let her, whatever), and is transported by some watery door into a spooky horror castle mansion. Her father explains, through EXTREMELY bad voice over, that she is in his mind, basically, and it’s being warped and twisted by an outside force that is changing him.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/rGuuikU.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>You control Laura in a first person view, quite reminiscent of something like Myst, but without clicking on specific things. Instead, if you walk up to a screen that has an item or something to interact with, and either walk into it or press A, you’ll just interact with it. It’s a lot like Lunacy, which was clearly inspired by it, and which I played last time. You must explore the mansion, solve puzzles, and reach your father before two hours elapse. IF you don’t make it in time, you immediately lose and must start over. There is no save feature, at all. The game isn’t long, you can beat it in 30-50 minutes if you know what you’re doing, but that’s a pretty fucking ballsy move, IMO.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/TjrPc22.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>On top of that, there’s a bit of RNG. The rotating room SEEMED like RNG when I first played it, but no, that’s just annoying in another way. No, there are beetles that appear in different areas of the castle, and most of the beetle spots are random. I found most of them, but I swear, in one of my attempts, I just could NOT find it in the 2nd area. I wandered for like 20 minutes in this three room stretch and could NOT find it, so I had to restart, cause I was going for the bonus at the end of the good ending that requires all 4 beetles and the good ending. Then, on my next attempt, the third beetle spawned in the pit near the knight. Which can be closed off to you, if you successfully beat the knight on your first try, which I ALSO had to do, so I did that, and then boom, had to just start over again. That was annoying :) Thanks for no save feature.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/k9bwn8N.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Eh, it was short enough it’s not a big deal. Anyways, the game is just about wandering this castle, but remember how I said it’s like Myst? Well, it kinda is, it’s first person as you move around these screens, but instead of just like, fading to the next screen ALA Myst or something, you watch an entire extremely smooth animation, as you walk from screen to screen. Laura’s walking is very slow, though it’s honestly impressive. It’s early 90s CGI, which in something like Lunacy was really offputting in a hilarious way, and it is in a lot of instances here, but some of the animations shockingly hold up, there was a lot of attention to detail put here for Laura. The little movements of her hands and wrist as she grabs things, her facial expressions turning to horror as things happen… Yeah it kinda looks awful by today’s standards, but I gotta respect it. The actual 3D environments also look pretty great still, IMO, though they’re not particularly interesting with just like, a screen shot. Here’s one.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/RD6WoBu.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>The vibe and energy of the game is dark and uncomfortable, with themes of cannibalism and violent action. You literally watch Laura eat her mother’s arm. Uh, spoilers I guess. How the fuck did this get past the censors in 1995, an era where Night Trap got the AO rating because of a woman screaming and being grabbed by some lumbering dorks in bedsheets? Uh… it didn’t!</p>

<p>Introducing Kenji Eno once again. When he made this game, he was pretty sure it wouldn’t get past the conservative American censors, and uh, he was probably right. So he fucking defrauded them. He sent them a clean version of the game, and then when he went to deliver the prints (hand delivered), he covertly swapped the discs on the plane. It took months for anyone to realize what he had done, but it was far too late. The game had a T rating, and you got to watch Laura stab her mother violently over and over and rip off her arm in it. It’s AMAZING.</p>

<p>Kenji Eno was just a pretty eccentric dude, in general. I’ve actually already talked about him before, if you’ve been reading my stuff for a long time you may remember I talked about Kaze no Real Sound, a Sega Saturn game designed for blind people, which he designed after talking to one blind person who said he liked D, but it was difficult to play. So he just, made an entire video game for blind people. Pretty cool. He was also famous for hand delivering pre-orders from nearby his offices. Oh, and there was the Sony thing. So he ported D over to the PS1, and ordered 100k copies from Sony. Sony took the order, then went “actually no, we’re only going to make 40k, we need to use our resources on games that matter,” and then they only ended up manufacturing 28k units. This pissed off Eno SO MUCH that he went to a Sony exclusive press conference, got on stage, and announced that all of his future games would be released for Sega consoles instead, and then walked off stage.</p>

<p>And yeah, they were. Things like Enemy Zero, D2, and Deep Fear were all Sega exclusives. Sadly, Eno passed away in 2013 at the far too young age of 42 due to heart failure attributed to hyper tension. THIS guy was too wound up? No way.</p>

<p>Anyways, D is kind of maybe not that good by today’s standards, but there’s a lot to love here. And it’s also batshit, in a good way. When I found out what the D stood for I was screaming.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Saturn" /><category term="retro games" /><category term="point and click" /><category term="Horror" /><category term="D" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 26 (lightly NSFW)</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/10/16/OOCY26.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 26 (lightly NSFW)" /><published>2024-10-16T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-10-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/10/16/OOCY26</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/10/16/OOCY26.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/GniIHHq.png" alt="&quot;I want to bare Akari's body... and to XXXX her and do some XXXXXX and while doing XXX to her XXXX, from her XXX to her XXX.&quot; THE POWER OF IMAGINATION OF BOOK LOVING GIRLS" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Hot Foot is one of the most important games in the entire UFO Soft canon, which is very funny, cause when I first played it, I got none of that, and it felt like the most nothing game I’d ever played. Let’s start with what the game is, then I’ll go into the very deep lore around its creation, its existence, and Gerry Smolski.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/DipnogS.png" alt="Hotfoot" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Hot Foot is another sports game, which I’ve already said isn’t really my thing. It’s based on a game Smolski and Chun played in their school as kids, and it’s a kind of variant of dodge ball. You have hacky sacks, which you are trying to skid across the ground to hit the opponent. You can charge your throw, which can leave you open to be hit. You need to jump over the enemy’s sacks as they throw them at you. Each jump will charge up your star meter, which can be used for two Super Moves. Either double tap jump fior one, or charge the strongest throw for the other. These moves should NOT be ignored, they are very strong. Hot Foot is all about paying attention to your opponent’s moves, and trying to react to them, hitting them when you’re charging, or grabbing a hacky sack, or grabbing a drink, which gives you star points.</p>

<p>It’s a lot to pay attention to, especially since you’re controlling two people at once! This IS doubles. You both jump at the same time, though you need to press the swap button to move the other player around. You can also hold the button to pass hacky sacks. This is a very complex double button game, and it’s kind of a lot to learn, which is a bit of its learning curve. Once you get past that point, it’s actually kinda fun? This game ended up growing on me, and even though the cherry requirement is hard, I ended up liking it quite a bit by the end. It’s nothing SPECTACULAR or AMAZING, but y’know, it’s an alright sports game. It’s got charm. You’ve also got cute things all the characters can say to each other too, like uh, this one guy telling a one eyed kid named Jerry that he’ll take his other eye too…. huh.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/gzKWQFg.png" alt="Hotfoot" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>…Jerry, that name sounds familiar.</p>

<p>That concludes the review portion of the review. Now let’s talk about meta story.</p>

<p>Hotfoot is made by Gerry Smolski, and is the final game that he made with UFO Soft. after this game, Gerry Smolski, remember, one of the two founders alongside Benedikt Chun, would leave the company, in a move that is sliiiightly fishy, as the company came under new management. This was his final game, a kind of send off, and a look into both Gerry Smolski as a person, and his childhood, because this game is EXPLICITELY about Smolski and Chun’s childhood, the history says that directly. This is their school as kids, that’s their coach, these are their classmates. Jerry is Gerry Smolski, and Benji is Benedikt Chun.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/AQhGAzz.png" alt="Hotfoot" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Quick side tangent, but this game ALSO takes place in the Partyverse, introduced in the previous game. The Monkey from that game appears here, and Amy, one of the playable characters, is the party thrower from Party House, as shown later down the road. She’s implied to be based on an IRL person from Chun and Smolski’s childhood, which is interesting. But that’s not what’s important here.</p>

<p>It’s 1986, and for the past year, something has been brewing in LX Systems. Or, as it’s called now, UFO Soft. They had been having financial problems for quite a while, with no big hits and not a large user base, but in 1985, they had their big breakaway hit! Campanella was a massive success, and with it, they got… attention. Introducing Tao Nemuru.</p>

<p>Tao Nemuru is the antagonist of our story. If you just look at the credits without piecing together who enters and leaves and what times, and how they work, he might almost seem like a protagonist. And HE certainly views himself that way. And in 1986, a lot of people in the company probably view him that way, too. Tao Nemuru is a rich man, and he’s entering into the company, offering to buy it and support the company with his money. He wants to be their CEO and producer, so they can keep creating the games that they love making. Sounds like a great idea, right? Benedikt Chun seems to think so. He’s on board with it, and is working directly with Nemuru, in an attempt to keep the company afloat. After all, without him, they’ll jsut shut down.</p>

<p>But Gerry Smolski seems to think otherwise… If you bring big money into the equation, if you have someone holding that kind of power and influence over you, it’ll influence the art. It’ll break what made us swap to games in the first place. The love of the game. So for the past year, there’s been conflicting power struggles in the company, but following Hot Foot, Gerry Smolski will leave the company, and Tao Nemuru will officially become the lead producer of every game after that point, and known as “the boss” around the office. Whether this will be a good thing or a bad thing in the end, only time will show.</p>

<p>Wanna know how I know all this? Gerry says it himself to Chun, and in Party House, his previous game he worked on.</p>

<img src="https://imgur.com/7zNit1I.png" alt="Hotfoot" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>It’s a classic case of developers hiding their feelings about company bullshit in their games. And it’s also it’s a rather classic struggle in the industry. The struggle of money, and of letting money control us. But the story motivations of Tao Nemuru are actually far, FAR more complex and interesting than they first appear, and while we won’t really see them reflect on the company JUST yet, rest assured that I will get to them, eventually. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>Oh, yeah, Hot foot. It’s alright.</p>

<p>One of the best, and most popular games, in the entire collection, Party House is one of two games that in my opinion kind of breaks that retro vibe. Because this is NOT a retro game. It is a modern game with modern sensibilities in a modern genre, with a slap of retro paint on it. This game is a deck builder, something that maybe existed at the time, but EXTREMELY not in video game form. It is a very unique experience for this kind of era, and in my opinion, absolutely whips, and is popular for a reason.</p>

<p>This is ALSO the start of a major part of UFO Soft lore: The Partyverse, as I call it. This universe, its characters, and the settings, all return over and over again, as cameos, or main characters. This is the first example of it, but I will harken back to the Partyverse a LOT.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/YRdPYXl.png" alt="Party" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>In Party House, you play the part of a party thrower trying to throw the PERFECT party. Every night, you throw a party, and as you open the door, a different guest from your rolodex will show up. Once the party concludes, you get two resources based on who showed up to the party: Popularity, used for adding new party goers to your rolodex, and money, used to upgrades how many party goers can fit in your house at once.</p>

<p>At the start you start with three different goers, or cards as I may call them, because yeah this is totally just a deckbuilder with a video game coat of paint. These three are old friends, who just give 1 popularity, rich friends, who give 1 dollar, and Wild Buddies, who give 2 popularity, but introduce the Trouble mechanic. If you have three or more trouble in your party, the cops will show up. You’re warned about how much trouble you have as it grows, and also Roof Cat is there to freak the hell out if there’s too many drunkards screaming in your house. If the cops show up, the party is busted, and you don’t get ANYTHING for that night. You can also get busted if a party goer has like, an effect that brings in another card, and your party is already full. That’ll drag in the fire guard.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/JAZ4qjc.png" alt="Party" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>The goal of every game is to throw the ultimate party, which requires getting 4 Stars in one party. Stars are the final resource, and are only given by expensive units that usually don’t do much other than just sit there. So yeah, fill up your deck with useless cards to win. It’s an interesting mechanic, but it works out! Once you get four stars, boom, you win! Now try to beat that scenario in a lower amount of days. There’s also randomize mode, which can give you some MEAN combos, or really easy ones. Some party goers are just straight up better than others. The climber is really just the best.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/YQAKat0.png" alt="Party" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>This game is VERY RNG heavy, and with no ways to remove any cards, it can feel like the game just fucking hates you after you open the second party in a row with three wild buddies, when you <strong>ONLY HAVE FOUR, AND YOU HAVE TWENTY PEOPLE IN YOUR ROLODEX THAT DON’T GIVE TROUBLE</strong>. Sorry. That happened a few too many times for me. Anyway, this game is extremely fun and creative and very much a “one more go” kinda game, but I cannot deny something I feel about it… it feels like it could be more. Something is missing, maybe there’s not enough here. Maybe I just want an expansion pack or something, I dunno. But I feel it could be EVEN more to become a PERFECT version of itself. But what is here is already extremely fun, and well loved for a reason.</p>

<p>Huh, interesting thing about this. Tao Nemuru is not credited in the special thanks for this game! :) That’s interesting! Well, Gerry Smolski did an amazing job with this game. It’s also cute cause it’s said that a lot of the party goer designs are IRL people that they knew. There’s a bit more I wanna say bout this and how it fits into the party verse, but I’ll leave that for next time….</p>
