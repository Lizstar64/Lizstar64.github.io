<p>So Dragon Warrior 1 was the first game I ever emulated, back in the very early days of emulation. But obviously, I wasn’t going to stop there. And if I was enjoying Dragon Warrior 1, why not try out its sequels as well? While DW1 devoured me, and I did beat it back then, I did not beat Dragon Warrior 2 until just now. And on further reflection, I know why.</p>

<p>This game is kinda fucked up</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ZByAS5F.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Dragon Warrior 2, or Dragon Quest 2 if you’re not an old head like me, is the perfect example of a sequel to an RPG. It continues the story, many generations later, in a distant land. You can go back to the previous game’s region and explore it. It takes the original graphics and gameplay and straight up adds to them, in every way.</p>

<p>In DQ1, you have one on one battles with a character I can only describe as “Ness from Earthbound”. Strong and kinda good at everything, though not as much at damage spells. In DQ2, you get a party of three characters, each with their own spell list and stat growths, so they each excell in different ways. Your main hero, the Prince of Midenhall, has no magic to speak of but is built like a brick shithouse and hits like a dozen trucks. Your cousin, the princess of Moonbrooke, is squishy and weak, but has a lot of good damaging spells, and supporting spells too. And your other cousin, the prince of Cannock, is very good at dying! He uh, is weaker than you in every way, and has less spells than the princess. He’s kind of trying to be a redmage, master of none, but he’s certainly a master of none, to a kind of meme-worthy degree.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/hF6pbWP.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>And since you get more than one party member this time, so does your enemy! Enemies come in groups, and if there’s more than one type, you need to specify which enemy type you’re fighting. You can’t focus down one enemy if there’s multiple of that type, it’s random who hits which, and if you try to hit an enemy that’s no longer there, you waste your turn. It’s VERY classic RPG bullshit, and they didn’t fix that for aaaages.</p>

<p>So yeah, it’s typical early Dragon Quest stuff. Wander around, kill slimes, go into caves and towers to get items to progress further in your quest. The thing about Dragon Quest 2 though is that once you get past the more linear early part of the game, getting your three party members together, you reach a town and get a boat, and now the entire game is wide open to you. And that means that you will prolly wander to a place you can’t survive in yet, cause there’s no guidance, and get your shit beat in. This is… not very fun, honestly.</p>

<p>Dragon Quest has a LOT of very cryptic hidden shit, and it’s all mentioned as rumors by towns folk, but you need to do a LOT of note taking and exploration to know what the fuck any of it means. And this game is not kind to that exploration. DQ1 had a bunch of cryptic shit too, I mean getting that item in that swamp? But DQ2 has a lot MORE of that, and in DQ1 it’s pretty easy to know where new enemy groups begin, and slowly progress further into new areas, but it’s not here. This is, IMO, to the game’s detriment. This is a game you’ll probably want to use a guide to complete, which tells you exactly where you can go without becoming paste with Vegeta’s face ironed into it.</p>

<p>The end game is also pretty mean. DQ1 was a huge grind fest, and this game is also, indeed, a huge grind fest. You NEED to be at a high enough level to even stand a chance of the boss gauntlet and huge-ass dungeon in front of you. But once you finish your grind, it is in fact a relatively fun game. Prolly better than DQ1, though I think I do prefer DQ1 more still.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="NES" /><category term="retro games" /><category term="Dragon Warrior" /><category term="RPGs" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 65</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/03/OOCY65.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 65" /><published>2024-12-03T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-12-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/03/OOCY65</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/03/OOCY65.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/WV6mQT4.png" alt="&quot;It's always been a dream of mine to kidnap the princess and hold her hostage!&quot; &quot;No, thank YOU!

<p>I’ve already talked about this one before, but hey, I mastered the set, so time to talk about it again.</p>

<p>This is a game set that I myself made! The RAM for this game is fucked, as the RAM for a lot of the sets I try to dev are.</p>

<p>Dharma Doujo is a SNES game made by Metro, based on their Arcade puzzler. It’s a very unique puzzler unlike anything I’ve played, except its spiritual sequel made by the same people, and a bootleg of it called Mang-chi. But other than THAT, it is very unique. You’ve got a stack of blocks, and you can hit anywhere on this stack vertically, grabbing the furthest left block. If you get all of the same block, it’s cleared. Otherwise, the blocks you grabbed will slide back up into the stack. Organize your grabs to clear all blocks and beat the stage, before the yokai climbs all the way to the top!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/caFDIXx.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>It’s a hard as hell game, mostly based on it being unlike anything you’ve ever played. You gotta basically learn a new language with this game. And it gets HECTIC. If you’re playing as the monk in this, the yokai is time based, but if you’re the shrine maiden, you can take your time, the yokai will only climb with misses. This can be good for learning the game, though there’s a lot to be said for lighting a fire under your ass.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/k0KqDT2.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>You’ve also got two unique modes for this game, which aren’t in the arcade! You’ve got Endless Mode, where a Tengu will knock blocks down periodically. He’ll show up when there are only two matches left to make, or if you take a long-ass time. It’s really kinda easy, at least it is to me, as I’m really good at this game. Maybe for noobs he’s hard as hell, who knows. The harder difficulties make it so that some junk blocks show up too, it’s not all clearable, which is fascinating.</p>

<p>There’s also a multiplayer mode, which is fantastic, but I didn’t have to do for the set</p>

<p>The other unique mode is Puzzle Mode, where a judge shows you a finished stack, and you have a stack on the left. Organize it in a way to mimic the stack on the right. This is very, VERY hard to me. My brain just boggles at this, and it gets really, REALLY complex by the end. It takes genius level brainpower. 50 levels, and a challenge for sure jsut after the first 10.</p>

<p>Over all, I do prefer the arcade version, but that’s just cause of the mild graphical changes. This version IS prolly much better, all things considered. And as a game is very, VERY worth your time.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="SNES" /><category term="retro games" /><category term="Dharma Doujo" /><category term="Obscure Games" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 63</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/01/OOCY63.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 63" /><published>2024-12-01T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-12-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/01/OOCY63</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/01/OOCY63.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/lUF36Ez.png" alt="&quot;If we get seperated, we'd never find each other again&quot; &quot;Crowds are the worst!&quot; &quot;Alright, let's hold hands.&quot; &quot;Crowds are the best!!&quot;" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p><strong>Rise</strong> - VOY
6/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/W02qh83.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Voyager is helping some friendly aliens who’s planet is being harassed by a bunch of asteroids. They can’t blow them apart though, no matter what, the asteroids are reacting weirdly. If they can’t stop them, many might die. They get a call from a scientist from the surface who says the asteroids are “Not what they seem” before he’s cut off, so it’s time to visit him. On the way down, however, their shuttle crashes, which is the only thing I ever see these fucking shuttles do.</p>

<p>It’s now Neelix, Tuvok, an alien they brought with them, and the scientist and his friend who go and meet them at the crash site. They need to get back up to Voyager with the scientist, but how? The shuttle is fried. Luckily there’s an orbital tether nearby they can use to get up, though it’s damaged. Neelix offers to take control of the mission, basically, and takes responsibility for fixing the tether. He wants to prove to Neelix that he has what it takes to be on this team. They find a squatter who’s been hiding in the tether, who threatens Neelix with a knife, but he’s a pleasant guy so he convinces her to stand down and join them instead.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/RmVZTPA.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Meanwhile on Voyager, they determine that the asteroids have some kind of guidance system in them. Someone is TRYING to attack the planet.</p>

<p>Back in the tether, the scientist they picked up is being a dick. He tries to leave without them. He gets in a fight with others. One of them tries to throw him out of the thing, and Tuvok needs to stop him. So when he’s killed, seemingly by poison, there’s no immediate idea of who it could be. (Though it’s kinda obviously just from vibes) It’s a good setup and concept for a murder mystery… though the pacing, and as I said, vibes, are a biiit off. It’s not as good as it could be, I feel. The scientist gives a warning about something on the roof before dying, and Neelix decides that they have to go up to see what that is. Tuvok, being a condescending dickhead, disagrees, and Neelix RIPS into him in a scene I kinda love, about how yes, he has no feelings about Neelix, as he says, but that’s the problem. NO respect, at all, for the past three years.</p>

<p>Anyways Tuvok goes on the roof and gets thrown off by the traitor, who’s the guy they came down with, who was working with some aliens who are trying to genocide the planet and claim it for themselves. Neelix is injured, but manages to sneak Tuvok back into the shuttle, who beats the shit out of the traitor and throws him out in a HILARIOUS scene that looks like shit in a way I appreciate. He and Neelix have a heart to heart, and they make it back, using the scientist’s information to take out the aliens and save the day. Yay!</p>

<p>The actual episode part of the episode was just okay, though I did really like the Neelix and Tuvok parts</p>

<p><strong>Favorite Son</strong> - VOY
4/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/LfhWsO6.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>As they fly around space, Kim is having some deja vu moments… including a moment where they meet a new alien species, he goes “I REMEMBER THIS, THEY’RE GOING TO FIRE”, then reroutes weapons to ops and opens fire on the random aliens. Well that’s fucked. Belanna gets second degree burns on her lungs in the ensuing battle. That’s VERY fucked. Harry feels bad cause oopsies he did a warcrime and almost did murder ):</p>

<p>He then has nightmares about it, and about being sick with chicken pox, and then wakes up with a weird-ass rash. The doctor can’t find anything wrong with him, he’s just… turning red in parts of his body.\</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Txsd0r8.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>After some study, they find out yes, those aliens WERE about to shoot on them. So uh, turns out Harry’s hunches are a GOOD thing, in a way? Especially as they’re now being chased by more aliens. Harry leads them to a star system, where they are saved by people calling themselves Taresian, who explain that Harry is a Taresian, who’s finally made it back home.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/lYhrmFs.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The Taresians are almost all sexy women who are rubbing all over Harry, and it grosses me out. Thats intentional, for the record. The purpose of this episode was, quote, “a male fantasy piece with a dark twist”. Well, we’ll see the dark twist eventually. The Taresians explain that they go around to other planets and impregnate women with their babies, which is fucked beyond belief, and then those babies will try to find their way back to Taresian space. Hey cool, can you help get us back to Earth then??????? No? Okay.</p>

<p>The vibes here are rancid. They’ve got a lot of weird rituals that are… off, and they seem to be isolating Voyager from Kim. But it’s fine cause he’s about to be married to a bunch of hot women, that’s GREAT! Voyager finds out they implanted a virus that’s turning him into a Taresian. But for what reason? :o</p>

<p>This episode keeps trying to be sexy, but Kim has this permanent virginity energy about him that makes it uncomfortable, nad not in the way they’re TRYING to make it uncomfortable. He always has the energy that he’s trying to get away from these hot babes and get to the nearest D&amp;D table.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/z0J6siN.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Harry looks for the only other dude who has were, and find him, a dried husk. Oh my god they <strong>SUCKED HIM DRY</strong>. Yeah, they turn aliens into them, lead them there with implanted genetic memories, and then eat their genetic code. Voyager rescues him, and they leave. Eh.</p>

<p><strong>Before and After</strong> - VOY
8/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ckwWkCq.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Fascinating cold open here. We see the Doctor, with hair, operating on people worried about their family member. He then tells the person that they were “the best friend they ever had”, and then used a “temporal bio-chanber” something or other on her, and then she wakes up and a boy is like “hello, Grandma Kes”. Ooh, some intrigue!</p>

<p>Kes is apparently 9 years old, so this is six years in the future. We see some interesting things, I always love seeing what Trek assumes it could be like in an alternate future. Kes has a kid with Paris, and their kid has another kid with… Kim. Kim, the fuck you doin’??? Janeway appears to be gone, and we’ve got Captain Choky, as we’re calling him. Kes appears to have no memories of anything, except for that first scene, and then she gets cold and wakes up in her room.</p>

<p>It appears to be that she’s living life in reverse. Everyone is thinking she might be delusional, but eventually she knows something she SHOULDN’T know, after going back in time again, so they’re like “okay, sOMETHING is up”</p>

<p>Apparently, B’Ellana and Janeway died in <strong>“THE YEAR OF HELL”</strong>. I’m sure that won’t be important. Paris rebounded with Kes, apparently.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/sl5MSvl.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The aliens they fought during <strong>THE YEAR OF HELL</strong> used temporal weapons, and they has caused chroniton radiation. And this, alongside the bio temporal chamber thingy are causing her to live life backwards, her first memories from her death. And eventually she might just… go back to her birth, or even before.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/V8xEZlW.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We have to watch Kes give birth. Whoof. This is DURING the <strong>YEAR OF HELL</strong>, and then we go back even further, to just the start of the <strong>YAR OF HELL</strong>. Okay I’m getting tired of writing it like that. It’s the <strong>YELL</strong> now. So at the start of <strong>YELL</strong>, Kes gets to meet Torres, who’s in a relationship with Paris, and then we watch her and Janeway die. Dammit. Kes is trying to use her future knowledge to help people, now not caring as much about fixing her problem, and worrying more about helping others. After she finds out she’s infected, though, she goes and finds out what the torpedo’s… variance was, so she can stop her backwards movement. She goes back one more time, 11 years before <strong>YELL</strong>, and they uh… throw some anti-chronitons at her. Did you know there’s <em>anti-time</em>??</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/rm9BxTF.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>It does work. She goes back to the start of Voyager, then to her childhood. This is horrifying. Her parent, or whoever it is, is kinda like “ohhh you’ve been on a starship, of course you have!” and she has NO way of fixing this issue. She goes back to being born… Then to being an embryo… then egg cells, and finally nothing. It’s black.</p>

<p>They maybe should have just stopped there, that would have been fucking NUTS, but no, now time is moving forward normally. She’s brought back, the anti-chronitons worked perfectly! She’s now back as a healthy 3 year and two month old. Kes now has all her memories, AND the future memories. And she’s keeping a lot of those secret… but she will warn them on the Krenim. I’m sure that won’t be important.</p>

<p>I actually really liked this episode. Really fun concept, done well, rather horrifying in a way</p>

<p><strong>Real Life</strong> - VOY
9/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/KBdd0QU.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We start with a Jetsons-ass 50s-ass family ready to see their husband/father off to work, as the Doctor comes back, and then transfers to Sickbay. Turns out he made a new Holodeck family, to see what its like to have a family. It’s kinda like something Data would do. In fact, he DID kinda do that once, though uh, hopefully this time it will end without me sobbing into my tea. He invited his friends over to meet his family, sounds cute.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, they are exploring space and find that some aliens blew up a scientific space station, and they need to find out who did it. These two concepts aren’t going to mesh well are they?</p>

<p>The holo-family keeps talking about how great the doctor is, and how he’s the best person and best doctor in the whoooole wide world. Torres, who has had a very, VERY not good family life, is EXTREMELY offended. This COULD be interesting! A plot that tries to show that the perfect neuclear family we are TAUGHT is the goal isn’t true or real, showsn through Torres’ fucked up familial history, sounds almost more MODERN than something from the 90s. I’m worried they’ll fuck it up though.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/qBWZ9bq.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Torres “fixes” the problem by apparently adding randomness. Now one of the children is a brat who is very very needy, the mom is exhausted and belligerent, and the son is trans-Klingon. Torres programmed his life into a wacky sitcom. TOTALLY on purpose, too.</p>

<p>There’s a scene where Torres and Paris flirt with each other. I… WEIRDLY don’t hate it. So there’s a thing this episode is doing. Torres is kinda… a character. Not just an angry woman who does her job. She’s snarking back, reasonably annoyed but putting her frustrations to positive things…. she’s reading porn. In the mess hall.</p>

<p>“Doc, you’re acting like you’re trying to cure a disease. You can’t… CURE a family” - Paris. That line is…. very good.</p>

<p>“Dad! what are you doing here???” “I live here, Jeffery, in case you’ve forgotten.” That line is. Also good.</p>

<p>Jeffery gets in with some Bad Boys (Klingons), and we see a knife they call their dak’tag. I was like “that’s no Dak’tag. I’m guessing they fucked up?” Nope. It’s a Kut’luch knife, used in ritual violence to hurt someone innocent to become a warrior. That’s a… very dumb ritual. Why would they do that and then call it honorable? Anyways, it’s a good twist for Trek Nerds like me to go “WAIT NO.” Also, the Doctor’s daughter is injured playing Parese Squares and is probably going to die. Remember that sentence I said earlier about hopefully this won’t end with me crying in my tea? That might be ironic. The Ensign ends the problem, because holy SHIT, he cannot handle this.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Ar0BBxs.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Amazing scene with Paris and the Doctor. You can’t have the good times and ignore and throw away the bad. The good things that can grow from adversity. The whole point of having a family is being there for each other.</p>

<p>Yep. I teared up. It’s pretty fucking harsh. And we watch this girl die, on screen. Fuck you, me. Fuck you and your ironic joke about crying. WHY DO WE EVEN HAVE PARESE SQUARES? THAT SHIT SHOULD BE OUTLAWED.</p>

<p>This episode’s A plot was basically perfect and hit very, VERY hard. The B-plot was uninteresting and barely there. It really holds the episode back.</p>

<p><strong>Distant Origin</strong> - VOY
9.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/nXtBN9q.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We’ve got two scientists, Voth, a reptilian race. We’ve got Veer, and Gegen, who find a Voyager crewman who died a season ago, and determine that his DNA is actually shockingly similar to their’s, which supports Gegen’s theory: The Voth did not evolve here, but are from the Alpha Quadrant. Now they need to hunt down this ship and find out what they can about these people. When they go to get funding, however, the People In Charge are bothered, because this could upset the balance (namely, the fact that they claim they are the most superior people here, and disrupt their power, y’know how it is). They charge Gegen, so Gegen and Veer go to chase after this dead person’s vessel. They have a thing in his tech that says they’re chasing after something called… Voyager.</p>

<p>This is a VERY good and interesting setup.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/IANmL5L.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They make it to Voyager, and sneak on board, cloaking to examing. It’s basically two nerds walking around and making biological commentary about humans. They’re not harmful or evil at all, just weird. And then they’re discovered. The Federation, understandably, think they might be dangerous. And they run away like “maaaybe we should explain outselves”, but when they’re shot at, and the younger one, Veer, shoots back, stunning Chakotay. Gegen kidnaps Chakotay, while Veer goes into hibernation out of fear.</p>

<p>Chakotay and Gegen kinda bond, because Gegen is a pleasant dude who just wants to learn about Humans, and Chakotay is white bread who can’t stay mad even when he’s kidnapped. Voyager discovers the connection between their species, that the Voth evolve from Dinosaurs… and then a Voth ship shows up. It’s huge. Like, HUGE. VERY, VERY BIG. Thousands of times bigger than Voyager. Voyager is literally beamed inside of the ship, and then the Voth invade, and COMPLETELY obliterates them. They can’t do SHIT.</p>

<p>Now Gegen gets a message. They have Voyager and will kill everyone if he doesn’t come to stand trial for heresy.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/qvtCi9Q.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The last part of the episode is a trail. Gegen is on trial in a kangaroo court, Veer denounces him publicly, probably cause he was threatened. Gegen and Chakotay defend themselves, and science, against conservative ignorance. It’s very well written, though regretably it IS held back by Chakotay reading his lines with all the temerity of a guy reading the TV Guide out loud. The bigoted, conservative minister is going to lock EVERYONE in a detention colony unless Gegen publicly denounces his scientific claims. It’s PAINFUL watching him denounce it.</p>

<p>Gegen hopes that someday the truth comes out, but he wasn’t strong enough to stand up to the powers that be. Chakotay gives him a globe of Earth. He hopes, one day, he can see it, eyes open.</p>

<p>This episode was FANTASTIC. Almost perfect. I wish Chakotay and Janeway’s roles had been reversed, but like, it’s so well written in every other way.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="Voyager" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 62</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/11/28/OOCY62.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 62" /><published>2024-11-28T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-11-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/11/28/OOCY62</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/11/28/OOCY62.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/FJYKc7S.png" alt="&quot;I'm showing you my boobs, so could you look at them?&quot;" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p><strong>Change of Heart</strong> - DS9
8/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/jdgvTjA.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We start with an ACTUALLY GOOD scene with Worf, where he bets on his wife playing a game of Tongo. O’Brien: “…You have no idea how this game is played, do you?” “…No. But I know my wife.” That’s cute.</p>

<p>Our plot happens. Dax and Worf are sent into Dominion space to get information from a Cardassian operative who’s been spying for the Federation. This is a lot catty married banter, which is pretty fun, and we get this famous line (sorry for the terrible quality)</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/310q8MH.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The B-plot is that O’Brien is trying to get Bashir into Tongo so they can break Quark’s streak. Namely, O’Brien is trying to gode Bashir into beating Quark for him. Dunno if these plots will intersect much, but this is a funny concept. It eventually turns into Quark defeating Bashir because he distracts him with how hot Dax is and how they “let her go” which is SUCH a Quark move, in order to win. Very dirty. Also I don’t like it much. I liked The Bashir that I thought had gotten over Dax in season 2, YEARS ago.</p>

<p>Dax and Worf need to try and get the spy out by sneaking through an alien jungle. They’re still joking around, as Dax said she likes Worf With A Sense of Humor, but as they’re joking around a fire, Dax is attacked by some Jem’Hadar and injured. Now Worf has to continue the mission AND make sure she lives. But she’s not getting better, and Worf needs to continue to extract this spy, with the information he has that can save lives, but it’ll mean death for Dax. But he can’t. He goes back and saves Dax. The spy is killed, and Worf makes it back.</p>

<p>Sisko tells him that although there’ll be no formal charges, because it was a spy mission, it WILL go on his permanent record, and he’ll probably never get a command because of this. Even if they, y’know, all survive. Worf made a decision that could cost a LOT of lives, and he saved his wife instead. No one BLAMES him, but he and Dax are NEVER going on missions alone again</p>

<p>Actually kinda good Worf episode!! Imagine that.</p>

<p><strong>Wrongs Darker than Death or Night</strong> - DS9
5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/haVhHZf.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>It’s Kira’s dead mother’s birthday, and she’s trying to celebrate it, but is interrupted by a message by Dukat, of all people, who’s like “Hey I’m here help you :D Did you know I FUCKED YOUR MOTHER? ENJOY HER BIRTHDAY!”</p>

<p>I know they’re trying to show that Dukat is unhinged now but that’s maybe going too far. It is funny that maybe the biggest fugitive in the ENTIRE QUADRANT came out of hiding juuuust long enough to go “I fucked your mother”. What an asshole.</p>

<p>Kira is obviously bothered by this, even though he’s a stupid asshole who says things to get under people’s skin, and it weighs on her, so she asks Sisko to let her go to THE ORB OF TIME. Y’all remember when we were collecting the chaos emeralds? Yeah, so the prophets send Kira back in time. She sees and protects her mom and dad (and herself and brothers) from an attack by some thugs, and then Cardassians show up and announce that they’re going to be taking some “Comfort Women” to Terok Nor, taking Meru, her mother, and Kira, under the guise of Luma Rahl. They befriend each other.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/YXBP2BI.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This episode is a lot of watching Cardassians, who mind you colonized and enslaved this population, skeeving and using women as sex slaves and objects, and it is very VERY uncomfortable to watch. And of course Dukat is there, being his slimy self, “protecting” who he can out of the kindness of his heart (namely Kira’s mom, because she’ll get his dick wet).</p>

<p>It gets a bit more ugly. Kira is kicked down to the slums cause she doesn’t take no guff, and her mom starts to, as far as Kira can tell, ACTUALLY fall in love with Dukat. So she decides to change the future and assassinate her mother, AND Dukat. Wow, uh, kinda extreme Kira? I mean, I can’t relate in any way, but it feels like a stretch. But yeah, she’s PISSED. She hates collaborators, you know how it is. But after she sees how her mother cries from a message from her dad, she warns them of the bomb and is sent back to the future.</p>

<p>I dunno how to feel about this one. It kinda just made me uncomfortable. Also this episode was made because everyone wanted Kira x Dukat, and Nana Visitor was like “FUCK no.” so they did this instead. Which feels gross. Very gross.</p>

<p><strong>Inquisition</strong> - DS9
8/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/QLRs89b.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>O’Brien hurt his shoulder kayaking in the holodeck again. It’s very funny that this keeps happening to him, dating back to season 2 of TNG. Bashir fixes him, then gets ready to head out for a medical seminar. He’s stopped, however, and assigned to quarters, alongside every other main staff member. Someone in staff is a spy, and internal affairs needs to find out who is it. They call Bashir out and this Willem Defriend ass mfer is VERY friendly. Very good cop energy. NEXT time they send him back, this guy is not so good cop. He’s grilling, hard, and Bashir gets a transmission from O’Brien who’s like “They are grilling me HARD about you, they think you’re a spy- okay bye”</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/dLpCcoq.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Bashir is clad in irons because they decide he’s a spy, seemingly just cause they want to find one. Sisko is annoyed as fuck, and is like “nope, I’m still in command, I will sit on the interrogations and make sure that you don’t violate his rights”. All of it boils down to him being genetically enhanced, and it’s a lot of circumstancial evidence and speculation, based on what feels like bigotry. They also believe that Julian has had his memories repressed and is a sleeper agent, basically. It’s like that episode where Geordi almost murdered O’Brien after being trained by Romulans. Remember that?</p>

<p>They’re about to illegally drag Bashir away and put him in jail, and he’s instead teleported out by Weyoun, who’s like “All of it was true :D You’re our spy &lt;3” Bashir refuses to agree with it cause yeah, why would he be a spy, he wouldn’t ever do that. So he’s like “why are you and Sloan BOTH trying to get me to admit the same lie… you’re working together for the same goal”</p>

<p>He’s “rescued” from the Dominion, and everyone on the bridge is SURE he’s a spy, and are all angy and disgusted with him, including O’Brien, who shoves him away… with his hurt arm. Bashir is like “But you hurt it with Springball” “Yeah, but it’s fine now”. ….It’s not real. NONE of it is real. He’s taken out of the holodeck, and Sloan comes clean. He’s part of something called “Section 31”, which is a secret branch of Starfleet that no one else knows about and answers to know one. They’re the Starfleet secret police. tHey were set up 200 years ago and have just been running… which is SCARY and VERY ominous. They try to recruit him, and he’s like “this is fucking disgusting, no.”</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/wHxMVs4.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Don’t hold your breath.</p>

<p>Everyone comments on how fucked up secret police are, and that they should do what they can to oppose them. And they’ll do it by having Bashir join them, and play double agent.</p>

<p>So, I know where Section 31 GOES. And I know I don’t like it .But that doesn’t reflect poorly on this episode. This episode was good and set them up as direct villains in a good way, IMO. Like, they won’t handle it well, but… I don’t hate the idea of “Star Fleet can be bad actually”, but I AM worried they will turn it into “Starfleet IS bad actually”. We’ll see.</p>

<p><strong>In the Pale Moonlight</strong> - DS9
9/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/YdQsQqo.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This is one of the big ones.</p>

<p>Our episode starts with an exhausted Sisko opening a log, and telling a story of 2 weeks ago… something that happened, something that’s been weighing on his mind.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago, on a Friday, like all Fridays, Sisko posts the casualty list of the past week. As everyone is morose and sad about dead people, they remark that a lot of deaths recently have been because people are over the Romulan border and then the Dominion kill them, because the Romulans are neutral. And that’s the moment when Sisko decided. He was going to bring the Romulans into the war. But the Romulans won’t just join the war, they need a REASON. They need PROOF of the obvious: After the Dominion defeat the Klingons and Federation, they WILL go after the Romulans. But that information is hiding in the Dominion.</p>

<p>We know who can help with that.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/hAVYaNm.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>This is as much a Sisko episode as it is a Garak episode. Sisko needs Garak, who is willing to help, though it’ll rip through all of his assets. And as things get worse, with Betazed being invaded, things warm up. They need Garak NOW. Unfortunately, all his operative friends were killed IMMEDIATLEY after he contacted them. Oops. But he has a plan. They’ll get the senator MOST into allying with the Dominion to come, and give them a forgery proving things are bad. It’s kinda… immoral, but come on. They WILL attack anyway. He’s practically saving them.</p>

<p>They get a guy out of jail to help them make the forgery. This guy attacks Quark like an idiot, and now Sisko needs to bribe Quark to not press charges, cause this guy isn’t on the station, you dig? It disgusts Sisko, and makes him almost call off the entire thing… then he gets to his office, and sees another list of casualties. People are out there dying.</p>

<p>His list of deeds grows. He has to take biomemetic gel, VERY illegal, and sell it to someone for a rod. He disgusts the people he works with, Bashir especially, for this. He threatens the forger that he will get him killed if things don’t work right. He’s falling deeper, and deeper into this.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/GGR2XrH.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The Romulan comes aboard the station… he’s pretty anti-Federation and pro-Dominion, but Sisko IS a pleasant man, so he eventually agrees to many of Sisko’s points, but of course he wants proof. And Sisko gives it. And now it’s waiting time… to see if the forgery worked.</p>

<p>It does not. The Romulan is PISSED AS FUCK, and says he will share this deception with the entire quadrant. But as he returns to Romulus…. his ship is blown up. All signs point to Dominion sabatoge. When Sisko learns this he immediately goes and DECKS Garak.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ZNEo3lp.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Garak had planned this from the start. He was pretty sure the forgery wouldn’t work, so he was going to kill Vreenak and blame the Dominion. The Romulans will enter the war, and all it will cost are a few lives, and the self respect of one man.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/RahkexB.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Sisko says he can live with this. He repeats this multiple times, trying to convince himself, and then deletes the log. Episode end.</p>

<p>We had a lot to say about this… I liked it, a lot. I dunno if it’s an ALL TIMER, but it’s very good, and very interesting. And Garak is of course perfectly.</p>

<p><strong>His Way</strong> - DS9
10/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/MIXM0L5.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>It’s time for the new main cast member of DS9. This is Vic Fontaine. He introduces himself with song. He’s a jazz singer from the 20th century, put into the holodeck! Oh, and one more thing, he’s self aware that he’s a holosuite program in the 23rd century. Why? Bashir, the owner of the program, says its just better that way. Sure. He’s a lounge singer, a nice one, and very, VERY observant. He immediately realizes Worf and Dax are married, O’Brien misses his wife, and Odo and Kira are… well, let’s not get into it.</p>

<p>Actually, let’s get into it. Odo is feeling anxious about his crush on Kira, and that she still just thinks of her as a friend. Especially because she’s visiting her ex, Shakaar. The fire is under his ass. He’s terrified of trying to change this, and also is, y’know, Odo. Quark gives him a push, tells him he’s gotta do SOMETHING, cause he cares about his boyfriend and wants him to be happy. But what can Odo do? He needs someone to help him…</p>

<p>He enlists Fontaine, who’s like “Dude you have no charm. We’ve gotta work on that”. We then get maybe the goofiest scene in the entire series. It maybe has some competition with them playing hopscotch in season 1, or the time Odo taught a jar of beer what a cube was. It’s three minutes of Odo pretending to play the piano, getting more and more into it, and it is so good.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/rMk8bw7.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Odo doesn’t get very much character development. At least, not like, PROGRESSIVE development. And here we go. He has to loosen up. Show his emotions more, he’s bad at that. He’s already a good guy, and charming in his own way, but he’s gotta loosen. We also get an AMAZING scene where Odo starts humming and singing to himself in Sisko’s room, and he’s LOVING it, cracking up almost.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/8xKgsJ5.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>KIRA, KISS ME, PLEASE</p>

<p>Fontaine, being basically a benevelent God in the holosuite, creates a Kira hologram to flirt with Odo and allow him to practice. He almost kisses her and then is like “Uh no, it’s weird, she acts nothing like her. You programmed her to like me. I could be reading prisoner reports.” When Kira comes back, and goes to meditate in the holosuite, Fontaine forces himself into her program… again, a God, and convinces her to go on a date with Odo. At the same time, he hacks the intercom and tells Odo to go on a date with his new Kira hologram he made tonight, for more practice. HE’S PLAYING THEM SO WELL. A BENEVOLENT GOD OF LOVE.  It’s also very fascinating cause he has AMAZING chemistry with all the main characters, like he’s alwaysb een here, and always well… and maybe…~</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/TNruJeC.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They have a date. Odo thinks she’s a hologram. Kira thinks she’s ACTUALYL on a real-ass date with Odo, and seeing this more loose Odo, who’s just being himself cause he’s not up in his own head with fear and anxiety about the consequences, she’s really liking it. She’s enjoying herself… a lot. Way more than she expected. And she keeps bringing up that it’s their first date. Their… FIRST date…</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ji7uiRo.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>It goes AMAZINGLY… Until Odo mentions that she’s a hologram, and ruins the mood. Cause then he’s like “oh shit she’s REAL” and gets up in his own ass again. He’s like “I’ve ruined EVERYHTHING” and Kira is like “oh god I’m in love with Odo.” She’s like “should I act on this clarity?” to Dax who’s like “uh, yeah?” and then all the tension is released, as Kira confronts Odo. They get in a yelling match like “Yeah, why don’t you just TAKE ME TO DINNER?” “WELL WHY DON’T I JUST SKIP THE FORMALITIES AND KISS YOU?” “YEAH, WHY DON’T YOU?”</p>

<p>And then he does</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/PCeHxFz.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Please ignore that his makeup keeps rubbing off onto her.</p>

<p>Everyone watches in awe. I would be too. Also some jealousy.</p>

<p>The episode ends with Odo thanking Fontaine, who asks him to leave the holosuite up for a few minutes. He feels like singing. He sings as Odo walks away, snapping his fingers.</p>

<p>I fucking LOVED this. It was actually amazing payoff. And Fontaine shows his first showing here AMAZINGLY, very entertaining. I am STUNNED I liked this more than the previous episode, but I mean hey, I’m nothing if not an idiot with bad taste.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="DS9" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry></feed>
