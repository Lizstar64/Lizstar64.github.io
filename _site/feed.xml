<p>UFO50 was a collection of 50 games made over the course of seven years by LX Systems, later UFOSoft. It was made in celebration of their 50th game, and while it seems like it might never have been released, it was found 30 years later by some nerds in an old warehouse, as seen in the cracktro intro for the game.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/KjLr1JU.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>So, what’s the purpose of all this? UFO 50 is just a collection of 50 games with a fake backstory. Why go through all the trouble to make a fake backstory, with fake characters, a fake murder coverup, and a fake CEO who hordes games instead of releasing them for people to play and use, cultivating a collection for himself and no one else? What is the point of UFO 50?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/0N91bUn.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>UFO 50 is about preservation.</p>

<p>As we get further into the future, more and more games are lost to time. People made these. These aren’t just products to make a profit, and they aren’t just code with no purpose. People put hours, days, years into creating them. They are the culmination of creative people who care about the thing they love. Games. And it’s easy to forget that, especially as these people and their work is swept under the rug. As the game are forgotten, lost to time, locked away behind CEO’s vaults in case they might possibly sell them in the future, or locked in personal collections and never shown to the public, those people are forgotten as well. All their work, their love, their passion, it’s lost.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/RHsIeEW.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>UFO 50 is about preservation. Greg Milk’s entire goal, from creating UFO 50, under Nemuru’s leadership, to hiding hints and messages and an entire game that shows him, his coworkers, and the world they had to live in, it’s a bright, blinding message that they were there. They were the people, the love, and the passion behind those games. And while someone like Nemuru might try to seal away play for himself, some might leak out, and be preserved, by those who love it. It might be played, and enjoyed, for years to come. It might, some 30 years in the future, be the topic of 33.8k words of reviews written by a dork in her basement. It might even be her game of the year.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/nMQoRA2.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>UFO 50 is about love. And I hope we don’t ever forget that. May it shine on, forever.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="Reviews" /><category term="UFO50" /><category term="Reviews" /><category term="Modern Games" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">UFO 50 Retrospective Part 51 - The Terminal &amp;amp; Miasma Tower - SPOILERS AHEAD</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/reviews/2024/10/22/UFO50-51.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="UFO 50 Retrospective Part 51 - The Terminal &amp;amp; Miasma Tower - SPOILERS AHEAD" /><published>2024-10-22T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-10-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/reviews/2024/10/22/UFO50#51</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/reviews/2024/10/22/UFO50-51.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/LcKO9Uj.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>UFO50 has a built in terminal. It’s not a secret thing, it’s right there, in the menu. This is implied to be the terminal of the computer itself, which you can use to access files and execute commands directly, rather than use the GUI of the game itself. There are a lot of more obvious uses for this terminal. Several games will tell you codes that can activate hidden modes and cheats, like the WOLF-PACK code that lets you play as four dogs in Grimstone, which I mentioned. But there’s also more to the terminal. A secret. A very, very in depth secret, which will blow the story of UFO 50 wide open.</p>

<p>The story of Miasma Tower is a very deep and interesting thing, and I am going to go very in depth. If you want to experience it for yourself, do not read ahead, as I am going to go FULL on with spoilers. Everything will be laid bare. Ready? Okay, let’s go.</p>

<p>There is a secret 51st game in UFO 50. Even before I started playing the game, I guessed there might be. This is the kinda game that screams meta secrets. But how do you find this hidden game? The most obvious, and correct answer, is the terminal. It’s gotta be chock full of secrets. But how do you get at them? There are a few ways to discover Miasma Tower, the hidden 51st game. I discovered it by noodling around in the menus. The terminal is like an old computer terminal. It has commands, and once you have a general idea of those commands, you can do a lot. A common command from back then was HELP. And sure enough, it works here. Each game has a four letter name, like UFO1 for Campanella, SAC1 for Mortol. But they are also numbered. So 0001 is the first game, Barbuta. You can do HELP-0001 to learn all the commands you could use with Barbuta. It’s very simple stuff, basically stuff you can find in the GUI already. The history, the name, etc etc. But if you put in HELP-0051, you get shown a different game. And it’ll helpfully tell you its name. MIAS. Input EXEC-MIAS to start the game…</p>

<p>That’s the way I found it. But there’s another way. A more complex way, and the way most people found it. When you look at the terminal, you notice something. It’s two words, each four letters, seperated by a hyphen. Where have we seen that before?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ssoYojM.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Our boy, Greg Milk. Milkdud here gave us a clue. Remember, Gregory Milk is the person who MADE UFO50. And he also made Miasma Tower, and he wants it to be seen. But it’s hidden away. Why? Miasma Tower was never meant to exist, and it was not meant to be in UFO 50. But it had to be, for reasons we’ll get into, so Greg hid it, deep in the terminal. And your first clue is by typing in GREG-MILK, which will give you a cryptic message.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/VgPY6ct.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>I’m not going to go in depth with these messages. They are a hidden meta puzzle that will take you into many of the 50 games in the pack. You need a knowledge of all 50 games to proceed, and as you follow Greg’s trail of bread crumbs, you’ll eventually come to a message that says “EXEC-MIAS”. So there you go. The other way to find Miasma Tower. But what IS Miasma Tower?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/OHQb5rt.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Let’s hop in and find out…</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/sGniQ2S.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>In Miasma Tower, you play as Gregory Milk. This is an autobiographical adventure game, not quite a game as much as a visual novel, showing you what life is like at UFO Soft. The game is explicitely from the point of view of Mr. Milk, who’s opinions, views, and thoughts are on full display. As you interact with things inside the UFOSoft office, you’ll see what Greg thinks of them, and how they effect the world, and the people around them.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/BwzGKx0.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>The game takes place inside the current UFOSoft HQ, and has all the workers and coworkers there. They’re all represented by weird little critters, but it’s not actually that hard to put a name to a character. This wasn’t really meant to be seen by outside forces. It was a game made by Greg, basically for Greg. He knows who they are. We have to do a bit more sleuthing, but based on where people are, what they say, and what their job is, we can make a guess. This is Meesha! The characters are all represented by little weird critters, and I like how Greg represents himself. He’s a brown lumpy… thing, with a permanent frown. If you read Greg’s inner thoughts, the man is clearly depressed and anxious. The years have not been kind to him, and the recent events at UFOSoft have left him with serious scars.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/VqDT6h9.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/3FNqXWv.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/amfRxi5.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/DOvoUgb.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Greg isn’t the only one. A lot of the people around the office are overworked, and exhausted. They’re being put on jobs that aren’t really what they’re good at, and being milked, and it’s pretty obvious they know. The corporate culture of the office ia also quite toxic. There’s references to a kind of hazing ritual that poor Shayn had to go through recently, which Greg is HORRIFIED at the idea of ever happening to him. Thorson Petter is hard at work in his office, as it lights on fire around him, as he overworks himself to death to add more games to Campanella 3. Why? It’s never explained.</p>

<p>And that last one there, that’s Benedikt Chun, the only founder left. He’s getting neurotic himself. He sold the company over to the devil a few years ago, for just the safety of being able to make the games he loves, and now he’s asking if Greg thinks anyone will ever play their games. What does he mean by that? I’ll get into that in a moment…</p>

<p>First, you should know the structure. This game is split into a few parts. You start in a closed space, and then find a disk and play it. It’s an old beta demo disk. After beating that, you get more puzzles which lead you to a new execute command, and now more of the offices are open. You then find another disk, beat THAT demo, and get more puzzles, and then even MORE of the offices are open. It’s an interesting progression mechanic, as you go through the past to reach the present.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/6Ez95fA.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/x86uYkS.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/6mqVmbZ.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>All throughout the offices, you’ll find references to the fact that the games that the company has been making for the last year do not seem to actually be released. The workers seem to know this too, as is hinted from that message in Diskonia I mentioned: “HOW FAR IN THE FUTURE ARE YOU READING THIS?”. What kind of company can continue running when it’s not even releasing its games? For what purpose? There are so many expenses, but no income. And yet, the HR accountant tells you flatly that the boss has allowed her to give out raises. They’re spending a LOT. The offices are filled with things that aren’t neccessary to make games. A barely used gym. A dormitory which Greg feels weird about using. A whole arcade and game room, filled with Nemuru’s personal collection. How can they justify this?</p>

<p>Becuase the point isn’t to sell games.</p>

<p>Tao Nemuru has connections to a company that’s hinted at in Miasma Tower in a few places: &lt;MPI. Or the Murtzbach Preservation Institute. There was a tester called Sten Murzbach, who’s name also leads to a code that shows a bunch of time capsules. What does this mean? What is the purpose? It’s never said, but we can make some inferences. And to reach that conclusion, let’s talk about the people in charge.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Xpqwsvd.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/P0it4OC.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/eNFmHWm.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>All of Greg’s coworkers and friends are represented by weird critters, but the people Greg doesn’t like are represented in two ways. The boss’s minions and enforcement, HR and the middle manager Ian Spinzer, are represented by giant groteqsue dinosaur like monsters. And the boss, his child, and their psychophant tester, are all represented by bugs. Nemuru is shown as having a kind of… cultist energy to him. He has a book of philosophy he pushes on others, the psychophant following it heavily. And that book is this one:</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/HLZ5X1s.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>The Grasshopper: Games, Life, and Utopia. I have not read this book. But it’s clearly at the root of the grasshopper and ant imagery, especially seen in Combatants, Nemuru’s baby. It’s based on the classic kids story of the grasshopper and the ant. Y’know, the grasshopper plays all summer while the ant works, then winter comes and the grasshopper starves like the ant plays. The book itself takes this further and turns it on its head a bit. It’s a book of philosphy that consists of rumination on the nature of games, told through reconsideration of the fable in ways that parallel the game, ranging from both the concept of saving games in preparation for a future utopia where we will play forever, and the framing of games as an obstacle.</p>

<p>That first part is the thing that really hits at key here. Nemuru is a games collector. He is shown to have a vast collection, and he’s gathering more. He’s very, very into preservation, but in a… bit of a twisted way. More of a collection for a collections’ sake. What it took to make that collection, and what it contains, doesn’t quite matter, so much that he has it. Murzbach Industries seems to be some kind of group, almost cult like, which collects and is locking away games in a kind of time vault. That’s why Nemuru is so interested in pumping out more games, and in UFO 50 as a culimation, a grand testemant to what they’ve made. That’s why there’s a paper showing multiple game companies, and next to UFO Soft, it shows the words “Almost done?”. They’re almost done using up UFO Soft, and then these games will be locked away, forever. For some idyllic future where the billionares will play and play.</p>

<p>I have a lot of thoughts on this, and I’ll talk about them in a conclusion to this entire story. For now, there’s a few other things hinted at in the backstory of UFO 50 through Miasma Tower that are extremely interesting, and should be shown.</p>

<p>I’ve seen people going “this game feels like it could hold a creepypasta meta secret, I sure hope it doesn’t”. I have bad news for you. We’ve got to talk about Chiffon Bola.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/feDbrKy.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/qwB17sA.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Chiffon Bola was one of the first people to join the company. She was a game designer, a developer, a bit of a jock. She likes bikes. She thanked bike clubs in the special thanks of her games. Some time in 1988, she went missing, and was presumed dead.</p>

<p>https://imgur.com/MMvWEoK</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/MMvWEoK.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/mIe5mCg.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/p0REdQZ.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Hints of her are still in the company, and any time you come across them, Greg averts his gaze. When he enters her old cubicle, he spells out I’m Sorry on the wall, and doesn’t elaborte or comment further. He doesn’t even say who’s cubicle it was, you just have to theorize. When he gets to her name in the company’s registry, he stops reading. He’s HAUNTED by Chiffon Bola. Later on, near the end, you run into a ghost of a floating bike helmet…</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/f6YacfY.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>The ghost blames Greg for what happened to her. Or Greg blames himself, more accurately. What happened? What happened to Chiffon Bola? Well, Greg has some theories…</p>

<p>Chiffon Bola very obviously chaffed against the new leadership as soon as they showed up. Everyone kind of did, but Chiffon seems to have been a rather independant woman, and would make her opinions known. In one of her games, Vainger, she shows the space station has being taken over by a malignant, insect-like force, who only wanted to save themselves, the universe be damned. In her cancelled game that you can find in her old cubicle, the cyberpunk RPG I mentioned, she deliberately calls the evil supervirus calling all the problems the Spinz/net.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/0mZRZI8.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Chiffon Bola clearly chaffed against leadership, especially Spinzer, who is a raging meathead dinosaur, according to Greg. And Greg has some ideas as to what happened to her…</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/O1xgJBS.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/gPy0fhq.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/jl5fb22.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/W5qkxzQ.png" alt="Secrets" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>You can find several hints that her disappearance is foul play. A detective is snooping around. There are stains near the bike rack, now empty. There’s a shattered bike hidden in the vents. The only way into the vents is a ladder, which is in Spinzer’s office. One of Spinzer’s coats is missing a button, which can be found in the stairwell. You find photos being thrown away, and you quickly avert your gaze, as if you don’t want to see them. It’s never directly said or explained, but I think the implication is clear.</p>

<p>However, I should specify that all of this is MY interpretation. Someone else could easily have their own interpretations about the things going on here.</p>

<p>In the end, Greg has had enough. Everything that’s going on here is too much. He cannot be a party to this. After he finished Miasma Tower and UFO50, no matter what happens, he’s done. You end the game by taking the Nemuru’s chopper and flying away into the sunset. I don’t think Greg LITERALLY stole their chopper, I think it’s just a metaphor. He’s moving on to different pastures.</p>

<p>And that’s Miasma Tower.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="Reviews" /><category term="UFO50" /><category term="Reviews" /><category term="Modern Games" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">UFO 50 Retrospective Part 50 - Cyber Owls</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/reviews/2024/10/21/UFO50-50.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="UFO 50 Retrospective Part 50 - Cyber Owls" /><published>2024-10-21T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-10-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/reviews/2024/10/21/UFO50#50</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/reviews/2024/10/21/UFO50-50.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/pw6QMPV.png" alt="Owls" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>And now we finally reach the end. The final game, Cyber Owls, released July of 1989. The 50th game that UFOSoft released, and as far as we’re aware, the final one. Cyber Owls is the biggest and most ambitious game to date. The brainchild of Tao Nemuru’s son, Winston Nemuru, who had a GREAT idea. It’s the late 80s, and you know what’s popular? Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles! Or things similar to that, at least. So why not make a game with its own tie in comic book, and create a MULTIMEDIA FRANCHISE?! Cyber Owls is goin’ UP UP UP, BABY, WE’RE GOIN’ PLACES!</p>

<p>It’s been a while since I mentioned it, but this pack is clearly inspired by a lot of sources, and one of those sources is Action 52. And alarm bells might be ringing for some of you, because this is EXACTLY what happened in Action 52. The CEO of the company was SURE that his idea of a super hero team of Cheetahs was going to take the world by storm, so the game was almost less a collection of games, and more a pilot for his Cheetahmen series. That’s what Cyber Owls stinks of. But it’s also just EXTREMELY, PAINFULLY of its time, in a way almost no other game here is. It SCREAMS TMNT. And Battletoads. And all those things from that era. It’s a team of quipping owls fighting pun-filled animal enemies. They have a favorite food, dim sum. They have a little mascot owl that acts as their mission control. It is EXTREMELY of its time. And while this kind of thing being popular might have been a reason for its creation, it’s not the only one. You see, Winston Nemuru was either dating, or was interested in, a girl at this time. And her son liked owls. That’s the actual reason this game exists. It’s a rich man’s vanity project, in an attempt to get a girl to like him.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/OQhW9mB.png" alt="Owls" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>But with ALL THAT BUILD UP, what is the game like? Cyber Owls is a multi-genre game, with what I’d describe as five games in one. You’ve got four owls, each with their own playstyles that you play twice throughout the adventure, and then a mini game you play if you game over, to try and save an owl. The plot is that the evil H.A.W.K. has a nuclear bomb, and you’ve got to find that bomb and stop them!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/dlKpLVe.png" alt="Owls" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Your first playstyle is Octavio, the dumb muscle of the group, who knows Kung-hoo. Yes. It’s THAT kind of world. Anyways, it’s a side scrolling brawler. You can punch and kick your way through waves of enemies in a side scrolling platformer level. Think a mega man, without the gun, ESPECIALLY later on where there’s a quick man level. You can charge up a punch to let loose a powerul blast that sends you forward, often into pits. I liked this gameplay style at first but it REALLY wore on me after a while.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/JvfdjFD.png" alt="Owls" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Next is an over the shoulder gallery shooter with Engle. Something like a Dynamite Duke. This is probably the best gameplay style, but it’s very on the nose. It’s exactly what those games are, and it’s VERY short compared to the others. Guin’s levels take like 20 minutes, this one will take you two and a half. Also at the end you find Mani-yak and Psy-cow. Because of course you do.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/HMWPCbo.png" alt="Owls" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Next comes Huxley, who rides a hover bike and blasts away enemies on the mean Hong Kong streets. It’s like a shmup, or like the Battle Toads Turbo Tunnel with a gun. Your bike is VERY large though, so it’s a lot smaller in scope. It’s alright, prolly my second favorite style, but just okay.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/0wIlm0m.png" alt="Owls" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Finally there’s Guin, the leader of the group. Of course a girl is the leader, this was made to impress a woman, remember? Guin is a smart hacker spy lady, and her gameplay style is shitty metal gear. This was immediately my least favorite style, and it still is. It’s… FINE, but there’s NO nuance like in Metal Gear. The guards are dumb as fucking bricks, and basically just have laser vision that you shouldn’t trip. If you leave a room and come back they INSTANTLY forget about you. And it’s just a giant fucking maze that’s really annoying to navigate and learn. And it’s so slow paced compared to the other levels, as I said, your first time, this will take your 20-30 minutes, and the next Guin level is like 30-40 minutes. All the other styles will take you at MAX 5 minutes to beat. Hope you like shitty metal gear.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/8gxG5pX.png" alt="Owls" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>The final gameplay style will only happen if you game over. You can save an owl in a turn based roguelike-esque puzzle. I hate these stages, I never understood them, and I still don’t. They aren’t explained, they’re very annoying, and not very fun. Frankly, just don’t game over. Just reset if you do.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Cyber Owls is a land of contrasts. 3/5ths of the game is at least okay, 1/5ths is actually GOOD, and 2/5ths is annoying and unfun. And I didn’t even mention the cherry requirement. Beat it without dying, a single time. This game drove me fucking batty. Or Owly, I guess. This was my final cherry, and it took me HOURS to do. I basically had to speedrun Cyber Owls, and I will never forgive the game for that. Something ELSE I will never forgive this game for is the implication that it helped kill the company. A beautiful company with an amazing backlog, creative and skilled developers, killed by a vanity project to get a nepo baby’s dick wet. I will never, EVER forgive Cyber Owls.</p>

<p>Also, you know how they stopped crediting anyone but Spinzer and the Nemurus by their actual names? Well this game finally credits someone else by name!! …The girl Winston Nemuru likes, and her son. They get mentioned in the credits. But none of the people who actually made the game. Fuck this.</p>

<p>4/10</p>

<p>Well, that’s it. That’s all the games in UFO 50.</p>

<p>…or is it?</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="Reviews" /><category term="UFO50" /><category term="Reviews" /><category term="Modern Games" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">UFO 50 Retrospective Part 49 - Campanella 3</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/reviews/2024/10/21/UFO50-49.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="UFO 50 Retrospective Part 49 - Campanella 3" /><published>2024-10-21T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-10-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/reviews/2024/10/21/UFO50#49</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/reviews/2024/10/21/UFO50-49.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ncjnQqA.png" alt="UFO3" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Way back in the Campanella 2 review, I brought up the “NES 2nd game black sheep” syndrome. I think in this universe, it’s actually the third game that fits that, because I can totally see alternate universe nerds playing this game and going “yes it’s good, but it’s such a departure from the rest of the series that it’s a bit of a black sheep”. Campanella 3 is the only game in the series that does not use the original game’s engine or gameplay style. While the other games were about navigating treacherous areas carefully, there’s no walls to avoid here, it’s empty space. While the other games had you use a slash attack to hit enemies, the Campanella has a gun here. It’s a VERY different beast.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/u8RO11C.png" alt="UFO3" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Campanella 3 can best be compared to onrails shooters of the late 80s, games that are trying to push the limits of 2D and go for a 3D look. Games like Space Harrier. And I love those games, but I may love Campanella 3 even more than them. This game plays so well. You’ve got a small playfield, which you can better position yourself in thanks to the orange borders that pop up as you get near. It LOOKS like a bit open space, but it’s eally a 6x4 grid, and as long as you shoot in that grid, you hit the enemy that’s in that spot in the foreground. You also have a side blaster, for when enemies get too close and enter the foreground. Fly around and blast the enemies. That’s it. It’s simple, but it’s fun as hell, especialyl as new enemies and patterns emerge. The game is the same every time, and quite a challenge, but very learnable. At the end of every wave of enemies, you are graded by the percentage you shot down. If you get a 100 you get a cute cat, probably the office cat, Lancelot. I tried getting a picture, but couldn’t get it in time ): You’ll have to get a 100% yourself.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/w0sRuLT.png" alt="UFO3" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>There aren’t many stages, just five of them, I think. It’s not a long and complex game, but what’s here will keep you very entertained. This is my personal favorite Campanella game. I know. The other two are very good and fun, but this fits my interests and tastes just a tiiiiny bit more. But it’s so hard to compare them. This could have EASILY been its own thing.</p>

<p>Perhaps the msot jarring thing about Campanella 3 is the ending, though. They just… left it at that? I assume they were going to continue the story with some twist in Campanella 4, but holy moly.</p>

<p>Also important to note, this game is ITS OWN UFO 50. Games within games, it’s the way of the future. Using the 2nd controller, you can play little mini games on the mini screen there. It’s a little unneccesary, and they’re very simple micro games, but it’s wild that they decided to include it. You can thank Thorson Petter for that, who at this point in UFO Soft, after having worked there for 7 years, as getting a little neurotic and overworked. He was the Artist, and this is a very Artist thing, but uh, didn’t you maybe go overboard by building FIFTY mini games for this one game, Petter?</p>

<p>Seaside Drive is the brainchild of long-time artist Shayn North, and his only time in the director’s chair. Thanks to his influence, Seaside Drive is a breath of fresh air, with unique art and style that makes it once of the best games in the collection.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/sPPmDNB.png" alt="Seaside" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Seaside drive is my personal favorite shmup in the collection, and it’s not even really close. While Star Waspir was top down, like 1942 or something, and Caramel Caramel was clearly a Gradius game, this is a side scrolling land-based shmup, akin to something like Heavy Weapon. You play as a cool dude in a car, equipped with little but a submachine gun. This gun has a power meter, which is only increased by letting your car skid backwards. Enemies come from above, and from the side, where you can use your secondary fire to shoot side bullets.</p>

<p>The graphics are pretty and vibrant. The music is wonderful. The levels are the exact same, but ENTIRELY different, as unique new enemy patterns come and go. It’s not too long, and maybe a little too short. It certainly doesn’t overstay its welcome. Inbetween each of the levels there’s a bonus stage, which is just breakout, which is pretty cool. The action is fast and intense, you always gotta focus to swerve and dodge enemy fire.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/6jT0swy.png" alt="Seaside" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>I do kind of wish there were three buttons on this controller, so you could lock your gun’s direction. There were several times where I wanted to swerve to dodge and still shoot at enemies coming at me. But you just gotta not put yourself in those situations. Seaside drive is an utterly fantastic game, and while simple, it shows not every new game in 1989 has to be a Mini &amp; Max or a Combatants, some big budget high concept adventure. They can be just a good god damn game.</p>

<p>I got a surprising amount to say about this game, which is funny, cause it’s not what I’d expect.</p>

<p>To start, this is a remake of an ancient game from 2004 that is still up on Newgrounds, and you can play it now. It hasn’t changed very much in the past 20 years.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/sAr3WnM.png" alt="Quibble" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Quibble Race is a horse racing simulator, with some REALLY dark twists. You bet on Quibbles, using their previous wins and losses as information about their stats, and then let ‘em rip. Quibbles have speed stats, and clumsiness stats. If they’re too clumsy, they’ll trip all the time, which is DEVESTATING. It’s not JUST horse races though, as you have several buttons at your disposal between each race.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/240ikcc.png" alt="Quibble" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>You’ve got the Infobot, which can tell you the stats of one quibble a day for a fee, very useful. You’ve got the loan shark, which I didn’t use once. You’ve got the ability to sponsor a Quibble, where you’ll make money each time they win. You’ve also got the ability to train those quibbles, which can be useful, but Quibbles retire randomly, so your hard work might not pay off. And then you have the back alley.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Thubiih.png" alt="Quibble" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>This cute guy can directly interact with races. You can dope quibbles, place trash in their path, injur them, make them go WILD, just wanting to constantly attack other quibbles, poison to straight up fucking kill them, or protect a quibble, in which case all other effects are stopped, and if another person is trying to effect that Quibble, they’ll face a fine. This ALSO blocks positive effects, like doping, so two betters trying to help the same quibble can cancel each other out. It can be very useful to defend though, because nothing is worse than you betting on a long shot Quibble, doping it up, and having it near the end only to watch it fucking die in front of you, alongside all your winnings.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/fJEfGoR.png" alt="Quibble" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>I should also note that this game fits nicely into the greater UFOSoft canon. You’ve got a lot of playable characters. Pilot, of course. Alpha makes her return. You’ve also got the alien from Onion Delivery, Brazz from Hyper Contendor, and this girl, Val. Val is a character from a cancelled UFO Soft cyberpunk RPG. Ah, what could have been.</p>

<p>Quibble Race is really just a horse racing sim at its core. You have a number of rounds, and you bet money in each of those. Whoever has the most at the end wins. It’s that simple. It’s good for what it is, but like… I’ll be real. I don’t give a shit about horse racing. At all. It’s not interesting, and it’s not very fun. But the game is still GOOD, it accomplishes what it wants to. I just dunno why it would ever strive to be that. It was alright to power through a victory once, but I’d never want to go back to it.</p>

<p>Also, some quick lore at the end. From this point on, something… troubling starts happening in the credits. For the final four games, no one is credited, except for the Nemurus, and Spinzer. Every designer, developer, coder, artist, musician, they are only given initials. We know who they are, because we know their names, but they aren’t credited. This is a very real unfortunate thing that happened, trying to stop people from having credits so that they wouldn’t be poached. It’s disgusting behavior, and it did not sit well with the people actually making these games. But don’t worry, Ian Spinzer, the guy who’s only job is to yell at the workers, is still credited! This shit sucks.</p>

<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>A Time to Stand</strong> - DS9
8/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/p8dXq2x.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We back to DS9! Last time, war was beginning. This, war looks like it’s close to ending. The Dominion War is uh, not going well. Turns out they’re scary strong. Moral is low. Three months into the war and they’ve beaten to fuck, already. The Federation is canonically really not good at war. Like, on purpose. They have literally one warship and it’s basically just a bunch of guns taped onto a warp drive. This is not the purpose of the Federation, so now they have no idea what to do.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/eVpiKli.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Garak and Bashir are having a lovers spat. Bashir has his sleeves rolled up and his shirt open and holy FUCK HE IS SO ATTRACTIVE WHY IS HE SO ATTRACTIVE? The gay energy between these two is rippling so fiercly I bet this one scene is the primary reason Rick Berman entered back into DS9 and went “NUH UH, STOP WITH THE GAY SHIT”</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/SqHtyVi.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>So how are things on the station? Well, Bajorans are slowly returning, though the Cardassians are not exactly… ready to Not Treat Them Like Slaves. You know how it is. Things are… uneasy, tense. But they’re alive. And Quark is actually shocked at how good it is. “As far as occupations go, this one’s not so bad.” He DOES miss the Federation, but things could be worse. There’s no slaves and class divisions. But with all the Dominion is trying to prove it can be a friend to Bajor, it’s obvious they don’t viedw them as equals.</p>

<p>A lot of this episode is a “where are the now” after 3 months time shift. Sisko and his crew are removed from the Defiant by some stupid admiral. Jake is a news reporter on Terok Nor, hounded cause his news is “biased against the dominion” cause he describes it as an occupying force. Anyways, what is Sisko gonna do now that the defiant is taken from him? Well, remember that episode where they found a downed Jem’Hadar ship? They put him on THAT thing and send him to blow up a White refinery. With the white gone, the Jem’Hadar will straight up die. That’s right. It’s time for Genocide. Usually the Federation is kind of against that, but I guess they’re feeling desperate.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/SqHtyVi.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Also Dukat is still the ABSOLUTELY worst, and he’s utting the moves on Kira. She should have bit his hand when he touched her face. Weyoun is TRYING to keep things peaceful, and I like him a lot even though he’s kind of awful lol. He’s also been trying to meet with Odo who wants nothing to do with being a God, but Kira suggests that he play the part, just so they can use Weyoun. So Odo demands the Bajoran forces back. Consider it done. Buuuut, Weyoun also wants something from HIM… it seems almost too good to be true. Now Odo is a council member on the station, and is in control of some policies on the station. Dukat HATES this, but turns out Kira kinda hates it too. With a founder helping rule the station, it gives them some justification.</p>

<p>The Fed Group goes to blow up the White station. It works, but there’s a problem and now they’re stuck in Dominion space with no warp, and it’ll take 17 years to wander back to space. Welp. That’s not good. And then the episode ends. Damn, cliff hanger.</p>

<p><strong>Rocks and Shoals</strong> - DS9
7.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/LOZHEhj.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Immediately after the previous episodes, they are attacked by Jem’Hadar, who realize who they really are. Dax is severely injured, the symbiont possibly as well, and now they’re hurtling down to a planet’s surface. Things are bleak. With Dax injured, and barely any supplies, now they need to survive. ALSO, O’Brien tore his pants. Wow, O’Brien must suffer, indeed. Also there’s a contingent of Jem’Hadar on the planet. They had crashed recently, and are struggling. There’s almost no White left, and their Vorta is injured. While Garak and Nog are out looking for water and food, they’re found by the Jem’Hadar, and immediately captured. The Vorta is very hopefully they can find them, and their doctor.</p>

<p>Watching the Jem’Hadar’s deterioration as they lose access to the white. They’re twitchy, they shoot at the Federation against orders, and immediately regret it. They cannot even cloak. The Jem’Hadar here are more honorable and it’s interesting. Usually the Jem’Hadar are meathead violent stormtroopers, here they’re characters. And interesting.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/3BQrVg7.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Meanwhile, back on Terok Nor, some of the Vedeks are going to do a protest. Kira is aghast at the idea. All it’s going to do is rile up the Cardcassians, who will put the boot down harder on the Bajorans. She doesn’t want that. At this point in the occupation, she’s doing all she can do keep things peaceful. The Vedek asks her, how can she stand there? She was a FREEDOM FIGHTER. She’s not even trying to stop evil. And when the Vedek publicly kills herself on the promenade in a display of defiance. Kira walks up the following day, like every other day. She walks into an elevator with Cardassians. She says good morning. One brings her coffee. But today, she realizes, as the room fades around her. She has become a collaborator. She IS what she always detested.</p>

<p>It’s heavy as fuck. But yeah. The politics of being in an occupation are heavy, and sketchy, and gray. The line is fuzzy. But if that’s how she views HERSELF, it’s how she views herself. And she has to fix it. I love watching it.</p>

<p>She and Odo start planning a revolution.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on the planet, Bashir manages to save Keevan, the Vorta, who tells the Federation that he’s going to order an attack on their encampment. But he tells them the exact plans of the attack, so that they can kill all the Jem’Hadar. Why? Well, there’s one vial of white left. And so they’re all just going to die to the Jem’Hadar anayway. The Federation are NOT happy about this idea, it’s morally gross, but Sisko claims he’ll go along with it, but when push comes to shove, he can’t do it, and he tells them that Keevan betrayed them, and to surrender, maybe they can find SOMETHING to do to help them. But no. It’s the order of things. They KNEW they were being lead into this, and they do it anyway. Cause that’s how they are. It’s kinda fucked up and sad.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/AGk2mN0.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They lose one man to the Jem’Hadar’s several. The Vorta is smug, and Sisko is straight up PISSED, about to shoot him, but life must go on.</p>

<p><strong>Sons and Daughters</strong> - DS9
5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/mmXTLTD.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Martok’s ship, the Rotarran, is getting five new members. And one of them is one young Alexander Rozhenko. YES, ALEXANDER RETURNS, FINALLY! We haven’t seen him in a while, though they certainly aged him up for this. He was like, conceived in season 2 of TNG. That was like 8 seasons ago, so 8 in universe years ago. Hey, whatever works. Let’s ignore that I guess. If y’all remember TNG, uh, Worf is the worst dad in the universe. And he is just as bad, IF NOT WORSE here! Oh boy!</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/CGTH8KD.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ziyal is back on Terok Nor! And Dukat is using her to get closer to Kira. Fuckin’ Dukat. Worf may be the worst dad in space, but Dukat is trying REALLY HARD to get 2nd place. Last they spoke Dukat left her to die cause she “betrayed him”. Y’know, by not going with his betrayal of the Federation.</p>

<p>Poor Alexander is being hazed by the other Klingons, who are mocking him cause they don’t respect his dad. When Worf steps in and stops them from straight up killing Alexander, Alexander is pissed. This is very weird for Alexander. He and his dad never like, had a CLOSE relationship, but those years on the Enterprise weren’t BAD, and it didn’t end in the WORST way, so this feels weird. This was the same Alexander that would grow up to travel back in time and save his dad? That was like, the last episode we saw from him. But I guess TNG doesn’t exist anymore, just like how all of Worf’s character development evatorated.</p>

<p>He’s going through his rebelious phase. And by that, I mean the writers didn’t know what to do with him and he was a plot thread.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ouqOc8a.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Martok calls him out on being a bad officer and using this as a spat with his father. They need people who won’t get the entire ship down, and uh, Alexander is very, very bad at his job. So Martok is going to kick him off the ship. Alexander straight up challenges his father to a fight to the death, which Worf ignores, but their spat is interrupted as they’re attacked by the Jem’Hadar. They end up bonding over Alexander’s overwhelming ineptitude and lack of skill. He’s the class clown. That’s… weird.</p>

<p>On the B-plot, Kira realizes that she’s getting WAY too buddy buddy to Dukat, and basically abandoned Ziyal, because she can’t ask her to give up on her dad, that’s fucked. It’s sad. But she can’t.</p>

<p>Alexander ends up joining the House of Martok alongside Worf. I don’t get this episode, in almost any way.</p>

<p><strong>Behind the Lines</strong> - DS9
8/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/WwLkdUY.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Sisko gets new orders. The enemy has a major sensor array that they’ve been using to know EVERY Federation move for the past several months. Get rid of it. Meanwhile, on the station, Kira, Rom, and Odo are causing mischief. There was a padd that Damar was using to write a missive to Dukat: They’re going to run out of white soon, they should just poison the last white and kill all the Jem’Hadar before they go rampant on the station. And Rom stole it and planted it where the Jem’Hadar could find it. While the Jem’Hadar and Cardassians are allies, they can’t fucking stand each other, and this is the last straw. There’s a brawl. Several casualties. Exactly according to plan. Well maybe not exact, maybe Rom didn’t expect them to fucking throw his brother over the bar.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/CUg0OVf.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Odo is not happy about this. He was against the plan, and didn’t expect them to ACTUALLY do it. He’s livid, if Dukat finds out what really happened, he could execute so many Bajorans, and he’s doing his best to try and keep them safe. Kira is like “you care more about the order than winning the war”, and he’s like “are you questioning my loyalty?” Nooo, of course not, Odo would never do anything to betray the resistance. Also oh hey here’s the Female Changeling. She was stuck in the Alpha Quadrant by the mines, and she wants to get very close and intimate with Odo. Oh boy. Of COURSE they end up linking. Ahh, Changeling sex.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ZG4nEfi.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Meanwhile, there’s a big mission with the Defiant, but Sisko is being promoted to the personal lackey boy for the admiral in charge of the war. He’s a bit worried, cause he likes being on the Defiant, but now Dax is in charge.</p>

<p>When Kira learns about the changeling sex, she’s kind of livid. Odo is like “Oh it’s fiiiine, maybe I can convince her to end the war! :D” and Kira is like “UH, NO, SHE’S GOING TO MANIPULATE YOU HONEY???”</p>

<p>In comes one of my favorite scenes. Quark gets Damar drunk and drinks with him.  It’s IMPRESSIVE to drink Damar under the table, and he stumbled into the resistance meeting drunk off his ass. He’s sick of this. He doesn’t like Cardassians, and the Jem’Hadar creep him the hell out. He wants to sell Rootbeer again. But he never will, ever again, because Damar found a way to stop the mines. So now they need to do a dangerous plan to stop them from re-opening the wormhole. Rom has about five minutes. Can he do it? Well, Rom IS the best. If anyone can, it’s him. Odo can shut down the alarms for those five minutes he needs.</p>

<p>….He doesn’t. He’s too busy having banging Changeling sex. Rom is captured. Ohhh that’s not good. That was their last hope. The Alpha Quadrant is fucked.</p>

<p>Also, Dax does just fine without Sisko. They don’t need him. He can focus elsewhere, and keep them safe doing his new work.</p>

<p>Odo is basically lost, and doesn’t care anymore, cause he had banging sex. It’s really upsetting to watch Odo get like, dronified this way.</p>

<p><strong>Favor the Bold</strong> - DS9
8.5/10</p>

<p>The Federation keeps attacking and retreating. Morale is low. They need something big. Luckily, Sisko has a plan. They’ll just retake DS9. Easy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Odo is straight up lost to them. He’s way too busy fuckin’. Like, literally. They were SOLID and they fucked, physically. Jesus, Odo. And she insults him and his fucking, cause it doesn’t hold a CANDLE to the great link! God this fucking woman and her great god damn link. Odo was SO BUSY fucking the female changeling that he didn’t even notice he had been at it for THREE DAYS. Damn dog. Impressive. And then they fuck again. Again, she’s kinda bimbofying Odo. It’s like his own form of ketracel white. It’s upsetting.</p>

<p>Kira is trying to release Rom, but he’s going to be executed. Welp. ): Poor Leeta is VERY upset, and Kira is doing everything she can, but Rom isn’t expecting much. And he doesn’t mind. There are more important things than his life. He’d rather Quark save the Alpha Quadrant and stop the anti-mine beam than save him. Rom is a real one. Legit one of the best characters in the entire show.</p>

<p>Everything about this is tense. It’s been very, VERY tense, for these past several episodes, but it’s growing even more. Overwhelming odds. If those mines come down, they’re fucked. And they’re coming down, now. It’ll only take a week. They need to do something. They need to send a message to starfleet, warning them. And who will save them?</p>

<p>Morn.</p>

<p>MORN IS THE KEY TO SAVING THE ALPHA QUADRANT. MORN IS STRAIGHT UP THE #1 REASON THEY WILL WIN THIS WAR, BECAUSE HE’S GOING HOME TO HIS MOM’S AND IS SMUGGLING MESSAGES.</p>

<p>Damar gets handsy with Ziyal, who gives up on her father again, and Kira beats the shit out of him. Thank God.</p>

<p>There’s a cute scene with Sisko talking about Bajor, and how much he’s come to love it. And how even when the Federation sends him somewhere, when he returns home, it will be to Bajor. He’ll build a house there, when this is over. Anyways, the fleet moves, getting ready to take back DS9.</p>

<p>Odo is starting to come out of his post coitus haze and apologizes, and Kira tells him to fuck RIGHT off with that noise, we are way, WAY past sorry. She is 100% in the right. Odo fucked up, harder than maybe anyone has fucked up. MORN stepped up to the plate and did more than Odo has.</p>

<p>The episode end with the fleet coming to bear on the enemy… who outnumber then 2 to 1. They’re fucked.
