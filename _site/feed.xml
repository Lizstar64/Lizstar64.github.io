It was basically a One True King plot, but with a president of the United States.</p>

<p>So in my dream, my brother was a member of some ancient order trying to bring balance and progression to the United States, and there’s a presidential candidate that they were trying to get elected. He basically looked like JFK, I’m not gonna lie. Anyways he was nearly assassinated and gravely injured, and we were nursing him back to health in my grandma’s house, for some reason, when we got the call of what we’d need to do.</p>

<p>While transporting the president elect to a small seedy town, we’d need to fake our own deaths, and the death of the president elect. Then, nursing him back to health, in two years, just before the election, he’d rise again, as if from the dead, and take his place as the rightful <del>king</del> ruler of this <del>realm</del> country. It’s a very Return of the King energy plot, but with America slapped hastily on it. And in hindsight, working for a shadowy organization trying to rig a presidential election is a little sus of me, dream brain.</p>

<p>So we made our way to this new town. My parents were driving us there, JFK in the back seat in a sick bed. And by driving us there, I mean we hitched our car to a train and were riding the train. We made our way to this new town, though my parents weren’t TOTALLY in on the story, they just thought my brother, JFK, and I were moving to this new town. As we got there, we went to the police station to ask for assistance, and my brother pulled out a fucking gun and pretended to rob the place. Shots were fired, he and JFK dipped, and I was left with a “WHAT THE FUCK AM I DOING” situation. I heard a deep voice bellowing in my mind, telling me to do the right thing, and I <strong>went with them</strong>, for some reason.</p>

<p>Now that I had faked my own death, I was stuck with my brother, lugging around this injured dude, in the seedy underbelly of this new town. We were assisted by two floating talking plushies, who had taken some of the bullets for us and wanted us to join their gang. They explained they couldn’t be injured cause of their plushie bodies, and my brother wisely went “Ah yes, but I’ve heard the plushification process can lead to some really bad backpain”</p>

<p>Anyways then I woke up.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="dreams" /><category term="dream journal" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Had a dream last night that I had to fake my own death in order to get the One True President elected.

Thorson Petters, the artist, was nearly fired for making the game on company time, but that’s okay because he didn’t really seem to like working at Business Soft anyway. I mean, with a name like that, who would? So he and two of his coworkers and friends, Gerry Smolski and Benedikt Chun, break away Business Soft to form LX Systems, a fledgling game company making games for the LX. The LX, like most micro computers, was never really intended for video games, the industry was still so extremely new. But companies like this began to pop up all over the place, and while LX Systems was not the most creative name for a company focused on making games on the LX, it would soon prove itself with its next, and technically first, release: Bug Hunter.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/6FJ8GMl.png" alt="&quot;Bug Hunter&quot;" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>In Bug Hunter, you play as a mercenary exterminator hired by a moon quarry to stop bugs that have been running rampant. Can you stop the bugs before they overrun the mine? To assist you, the owners of the quarry will drop energy blocks on you, which can be used to upgrade your weapons.</p>

<p>The game is an extremely interesting strategy puzzle game. You have slots for seven actions. You start with very simple actions, run, jump, shoot, and lob. As you collect energy, you can spend it to change out your actions for a new action. This also refreshes the action, so if you have the energy, you can keep cashing out to do more and more things in one turn. Each turn, bugs and energy will spawn, and your goal is very simple. Kill the bugs. If a bug is not killed in a turn, it will evolve into a new form of bug. These bugs all have different abilities, some way worse than others. You’ve got bugs that make holes when they die, bugs that turn energy into anti-energy near them, bugs that explode when they die, bugs that create fodder and can’t be killed unless you kill the fodder (the worst), bugs that take two hits (the OTHER worst). And after they evolve, then evolve again into scarier forms, they will become… take a guess… yep, that’s right.</p>

<p>An egg. Oh, Petters.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/4a8p0OE.png" alt="&quot;A screen of Bug Hunter&quot;" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>And then if you can’t kill the egg, it will hatch and you’ll IMMEDIATELY lose. Eggs also don’t count towards your kills, so it’s best to not even let them get to that point. On top of needing 30 bug kills to win a round, you also need to finish in ten days. So an average of 3 bugs a day. Not too bad, right? Well, it can get pretty hectic, and it feels very RNG heavy. Some bug types feel like straight up run killers. It’s probably easier in multiplayer, and it DOES have one of those though I haven’t tested it, but the game is a real brain tickler. It also helps to remember you can mario stomp enemies by walking on them from heights, I kept forgetting that. Also, you can shoot energy to make it explode and kill enemies around it. But it can ALSO kill you, so be careful. For being a 1983 brain tickling puzzler, it’s shockingly kind, because if you’re targetting things, it’ll show where an energy explosion will reach, including all the chain reactions. Very pleasant.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/A9TgS0z.png" alt="&quot;The bug threat has evolved!&quot;" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Overall, Bug Hunters is an interesting game, but not one I’d go back to every much. I got my 6 runs in a row for the cherry, and that was probably good for me. It has no music, and the graphics are primative, but pleasant enough. It feels weirdly isolating and uncomfortable, which hey, that fits. It also introduces Benedikt Chun and Gerry Smolski into the story as the other two co-founders of the company. Though they don’t have a chance to really shine here, we’ll learn more about them later.</p>

<p>“Explore the castle but watch out for traps!”</p>

<p>I’ll begin my review of Barbuta by telling a story. I was showing UFO 50 to my girlfriend Amethyst, and showing her some games. “Oh this is a platformer” “It’s a cute arcadey game I like”. Then I got to this game, and said “Please tell me what you think this game is, in the next 5 seconds”. I then walked to the right, stepped on a nearly invisible switch, and got killed immediately by a falling block. Excitedly, she went “Oh, it’s a Mulana!”</p>

<p>Barbuta is the first game in UFO 50, a collection of 50 games inspired by the 80s. And as I explained in the Primer, which if you haven’t seen you should consider looking at, all 50 games are based on vibes and energies and designs of the 80s, and are from an alternate universe where this company, UFO Soft, made these games. In this case however, it’s not QUITE a UFO Soft game.</p>

<p>In the 80s, Thorson Petter worked at a company named Business Software. What we know, is that in the early 80s, 1982 to be exact, Petters developed this game secretly on company time. When it was discovered, he was nearly fired. This is actually pretty common for back then. Many microPC games from the early 80s were made by a single dude just trying to work on it as a hobby in his off time. It wasn’t meant to be a huge success. It wasn’t meant to make money, even. It was an art project, if anything. And that’s what Thorson Petters is. Our first character in the story of UFO Soft, Thorson is our artist. The weirdo. His stuff he makes is challenging, weird, and EXTREMELY interesting. Like this game.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/dkzTiG1.png" alt="&quot;Puzzly Bullshit&quot;" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Inspired by early 80s microPC games, this game feels EXTREMELY British, in a game no other game feels like in UFO 50. You play as a little knight in a Barbute helmet, exploring a big castle. There’s no explanation. No story. Not even a title screen. It’s you and a castle. There are some NPCs, blobs, who will give you a few hints, but you need to explore and solve the puzzles yourself. And this is a very, VERY janky puzzle platformer. You move slow as shit, have a dinky short range sword, there’s no music, you die in one hit and have 6 lives, represented by eggs that you then hatch out of. Note those eggs for later, mind you.</p>

<p>Puzzles can range from “oh okay”, like striking blocks that look cracked to reveal a secret passage, to “ohhh god dammit, okay”, where after you find the solution it makes to perfect sense, to complete bullshit stuff I found COMPLETELY by accident. It’s not unfun to explore or play, but it is for sickos. This game is a sickos game. If you like La-Mulana, Maze of Galious, or any of those old ZX spectrum games, you’ll enjoy this one.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/2ryuCWi.png" alt="&quot;Platforming... goodness??&quot;" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>I should explain that each game has three things you can do. 1) You can get the Garden unlockable. This is usally a halfway point kinda thing, which gives a little item for a tomagachi game. Next is golding it, this is usually just beating the game. Then there’s cherrying it, which is like 100% usually, or beating it with an additional qualifier. In this case, Gardening it is exploring half the rooms, beating it is beating the final boss, and cherrying it is beating it with full eggs. It’s not AS hard as it seems, but it is a tough some of a bitch for the uninitiated. But when you do succeed, when you figure it out, ooooh there’s no better feeling. But it is EXTREMELY not for everyone, you have been warned.</p>

<p>It’s also important to note that it is SO not for everyone, that I’ve heard stories of people buying this pack of games, playing Barbuta cause it’s the first game in the collection, and then <strong>refunding the entire thing</strong>. Very stupid, but I’m not surprised.</p>

Since then I keep instinctively opening tabs to check what people have been saying.</p>

<p>So, this is it. This is my home now. It feels…. quiet. Kind of isolating. I do like this blog conceptually, for being able to post all my longform content and thoughts, but it feels a lot more clunky for shortform content. If I just wanna wake up and go “Yo where the bitches at”, it takes a lot more effort to write up that html file. I assume I’ll get into my groove eventually and shitpost to my heart’s content.</p>

<p>I have a lot of thoughts about Cohost closing. Most of them sad. I’m also real sad that I can’t edit my posts anymore. And by that I mean, like, get into the edit page. It made it easier for me to grab all my code so I could port it over here. There was also this very weird thing. So, Imgur won’t accept copy and pasted images from cohost… unless they’re from the edit page. I have NO clue why. So I would go into the edit page to grab my images for porting over Out of Context Yuri and stuff, but that’s not a thing no more. So now I gotta work a little harder, and it’s annoying lol. Hopefully the export helps me out.</p>

<p>Recently I haven’t been posting as much, but it’s not cause I’m already bored of this place or something. It’s more that I’ve been no-lifing UFO 50. Have you played UFO 50? Play UFO 50. I’ll prolly be posting full big posts about the games. Would y’all be interested in a series where I review all of the games in that pack? If not, I’ll prolly just do one big review. But it’ll be a while before that.</p>

<p>I’ve also been playing Zelda. Too many games came out recently. I ALSO want to get to Flowstone Saga, the Tetris JRPG. But there’s TOO MUCH TO PLAY. So Retro Achievements is getting a bit of a backseat for a bit, I think,  as I focus on these. Of course, we’ll be getting yuri every day, still.</p>

<p>Hope y’all have a lovely rest of yoru week!</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="misc" /><category term="just chatting" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday Cohost closed its doors.

<p>UFO 50 is a game that came out September 18th, made by Mossmouth. I’d not heard of it until about two months ago, when I was playing Monkey Ball on stream and someone went “HOLY SHIT UFO50 GOT A RELEASE DATE” and I was like “what”. When they explained the game and its history to me, I went “huh, okay”, with a bit of a shrug. Sounded kinda neat sure, but I had a lot of other stuff to play. I’d MAYBE check it out.</p>

<p>I am now 60 hours in, and 18 game cherried, after less than a week of owning it. I am UFO pilled. I have been defeated. This game won. It’s now probably my game of the year, and it’s not even really close.</p>

<p>Mossmouth is a collection of indie developers that made games you’ve probably heard of. The biggest dude is Derek Yu, who made Spelunky, though it also has the developer of Downwell on it. It’s basically a supergroup made out of indie devs with one super popular hit. It was announced in 2017, to a release date of 2018, which got pushed back by six years, because did you know making <strong>50 video games is hard?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, UFO50 is 50 video games in one. For 25 bucks, you can own 50 games. These aren’t Warioware micro games. These are full fledged-ass games. 80s games, so not SUPER long, but there IS a JRPG in here, and it IS apparently like, ten hours long. A ten hour long NES-style JRPG for 50 cents. Good lord.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/6xFMmCe.png" alt="&quot;An LX with PLAY FOREVER &quot;" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>But it’s not just the games that make this worth playing. The actual conceit off the game is something special all by itself. It’s not JUST a pack of 50 games all by itself, its a love letter to the 80s. The entire game is built into a framing device: Derek Wu and all those people I mentioned earlier? They didn’t make this. They found a floppy disk in an old warehouse filled with a compilation of 50 games for an ancient 80s microPC called the LX. They spent a few years porting it to modern PCs, and here you are! UFOSoft (in the framing device, mind you) was a company that existed in the mid to late 80s, and made 50 games, which seem to have fallen into obscurity, but here they all are, in one collection! The game is almost less about the games to me, and more about the fictional world it builds.</p>

<p>You can see the different developers, all fake people, who grow and develop these games. You see ideas and assets get reused and iterated on. Characters and concepts return all the time. And it almost ALL feels authentic. Not EVERYTHING, we’ll get to it in this series, but a lot of it does. This is very 80s gaming, at its finest. And even though none of this is real, it feels so real. There’s a memorium for someone in the credits of one of the games, and I felt sad. For someone who does not exist. I form bonds with these fake-ass people. Thorson Petters is my MAN, and Greg-Milk is, of course, the GOAT.</p>

<p>So for the next little while, every now and then, I’ll post a full on in depth review of every one of the UFO 50 games. There’s a lot of them. Almost 50 of them, even! And I’ll go into the little details and thoughts as I see and find them. If you don’t want to be spoiled though, and just want to know if you should get this game. Uh, yeah. Yeah you should.</p>
