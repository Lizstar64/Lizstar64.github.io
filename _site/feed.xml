<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p>So, there’s only one more episode left in DS9 season 6. We’re going to watch it next week, where I’ll repost this with the additional episode.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>The Reckoning</strong> - DS9
7/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/fiK79p8.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The war is going bad, though a BIT better with the Romulans entering. That’s good! Odo and Kira are cute and lovey dovey now which will take some getting used to.</p>

<p>Anyways, Sisko, Kira, and Jake go down to Bajor, cause apparently some monks found a thing that might be important for the Emissary. Jake is being a weird little bitch about it like “Why is my dad okay with being Jesus now, why are we here, isn’t there more important stuff to worry about”. Jake. You’re an adult now. You’re like, 20. You don’t need to tag along when your dad goes away. As they see some old door that says “Welcome Emissary”, Sisko gets a vision that tells him that THE RECKONING APPROACHES.</p>

<p>They bring the stone door up to the station and give it to Dax, who has one of my favorite lines. “Yep, I know what this was the moment I laid eyes on it. It’s a hunk of stone with some writing on it.”</p>

<p>Sisko: “The prophets are never clear in their messages”</p>

<p>Kai Winn: “Ah, I wouldn’t know. They’ve never spoken to me.”</p>

<p>WHY IS THIS WOMAN POPE?? Anyways Kai Winn is a bitch like she always is, and demands the stone tablet back, just cause she’s a weirdo xenophobe. And then they translate the tablet and it says, very clearly: “DS9 is going to blow up”. Uh oh. And then the wormhole gets unstable and it starts fucking up Bajor.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/2ulIDbN.png" alt="trek" />
<img src="https://imgur.com/x5XQf56.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>And then Sisko gets fed up with it all and throws the fucking tablet against the wall. We then see Things release from it. I’m sure that’s fine.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/yPjAwhq.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We then find out what’s happening. Some Prophets and some Pah-Wraiths were released. The Prophet takes Kira, who it says is willing so that’s fine, and says that it is going to fight a Pah-Wraith here once it takes its own body to fight with. Kai Winn is like “FINALLY, A PROPHET” and begs it to give her something to do, she wants to help, and its basically like “who are you” by just, ignoring her.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/KBoEKlv.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They call for an evacuation, and everyone leaves, except Winn who’s being annoying as always, and we see the Pah Wraith’s choice of body: Jake. There’s a lot of body horror in his face, it’s extremely upsetting to watch. There’s a fucking DBZ-ass battle, with energy beams, and it’s unsure who’s going to win, and who might die… Until Kai Wrinn uses a button that hurts Prophets, and knocks them out of their body. Why? We don’t know. She goes “Prophets forgive me…” but uh, I dunno if they will.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that everything that follows is probably her fault. The prophets said everything would be good if they win, which wasn’t guaranteed, but it looked like it was. So yeah, she just killed a LOT of people, and Space Satan is still out there. Kira calls her out on it, and blames it on her pride, which y’know, makes sense. It’s what the whole episode was about.</p>

<p>Interestng lore, just alright episode.</p>

<p><strong>Valiant</strong> - DS9
8.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/JLpcQmR.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>While Jake and Nog are going to Ferenginar to deliver a thing to the Grand Nagus, they’re attacked by some Jem’Hadar, oh no! They’re rescued by… the Defiant! Nope, not the Defiant, it’s a ship called The Valiant, which is clearled based on the Defiant. So they’re trying to mass produced the Defiant now. That’s… gonna go well I’m sure. The people on the ship are all cadets… kind of. Turns out they’re RED SQUADRON! You may not remember them. They were the Elite of the Elite cadets at the Acadamy. They ALSO tried to help set up a coup a season or two ago. They explain that they were supposed to just be on a training exercise (the same one they were sent on in that episode actually), and then all the senior crew died in an attack, and one of them, Shepard, took command and now they’re stuck behind enemy lines and basically doing run and hide tactics to hit at the Dominion.</p>

<p>They invite Nog in to join them, and Nog’s always looked up to Red Squad, so he’s on board, and they need an engineer. But Nog is a little suspicious… because this captain seems to be doing this under the radar, and all the missions are sent to the dead captain instead of him, and they don’t know he’s just assumed command. But everything is on the level so far. So far.</p>

<p>Jake befriends the doctor on board, and asks her about home. This gets her kinda emotional and missing home. Y’know, normal human stuff. But this is a WAR and we are a MILITARY. Please ignore the fact that Starfleet is not, in fact, military. They are a MILITARY. They bring her and Jake in and are like “You are not allowed to be friends because you’ll DISTRACT THEM”. Also, the captain appears to be addicted to pills, and is kinda wigging out in a very sussy way. Jake is side eying all of this.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/OOB1m6S.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They’re all just kids. They’re kids who are thrust into a situation they aren’t ready to handle, and they are kids who are basically being used to play out the captain’s Captain Fantasies.</p>

<p>Jake is thrown in the brig because he’s questioning this guy’s bullshit. Everyone else has kinda swallowed the poison. The captain has them go attack a destroyer. It’s basically like the Millenium Falcon trying to blow up a Star Destroyer. It does not go well. It predictably does not go well, and everyone starts dying as the Explodium goes off. It’s now just Nog and the girl Jake befriended, and then they rescue Jake from the brig and escape in a pod, barely making it out. The girl is like “the captain was a good man, and if he failed that means we failed him.” She’s STILL drinking the coolaid, but Nog makes the episode’s message clear: He may have been a good man. But he was a bad captain. And he killed a lot of innocent people with his arrogance.</p>

<p><strong>Profit And Lace</strong> - DS9
1.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/zdayXgW.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Here it is. One of the big ones. This is often considered the worst episode of DS9 of all time. And as a woman myself, I am sure I will have a LOT of opinions about it. But who knows? Maybe it’ll surprise us, and be good!</p>

<p>The episode starts with Quark sexually harassing one of his workers by demanding she sleep with him or he’ll fire her.</p>

<p>Well, that didn’t last long!</p>

<p>Anywayst the REAL episode starts when Grand Nagus Zek shows up on DS9 with Quark and Rom’s mom, Moogie. She’s wearing clothes! and in PUBLIC! Zek explains that he recently passed a law that allows women to wear clothes. And if they can wear clothes, they can go out in public. And if they do that, they can make profit. Yay! Unfortunately, this caused societal upheaval, and all the men in power banded together to depose Zek, and now Brunt is acting Grand Nagus, to be sworn in in only a few days. Zek drags the other main character Ferengi in trying to get people on his side. It doesn’t go well. Everyone is sexist. Fuck, even Zek is. He’s progressive… for a Ferengi. Anyways they get ONE person on their side, ready to see a female to prove females can interface with society</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/gk5PrgF.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Brunt continues to be the most punchable man in the galaxy.</p>

<p>Quark and Moogie get in an argument and she has a heart attack. That’s not good. They need a woman to show to this guy, but where are they going to get one?</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/AHWrcp5.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Good thing Bashir does gender reassignment surgeries like every other day. It IS the 24th century.</p>

<p>Yes. That’s right. This is the transgender episode. Kind of. It’s actually the Gender Bender episode, but like, this hits a lot of trans energy. And not in a good way. Quark is now a woman, MEDICALLY, like he’s filled with estrogen. And it’s making her emotional. Ha ha, you know them women. ALWAYS emotional. They have a lot of things to grill Quark on, she has to be presentable in like, 12 hours. She needs to work on her walk. And her voice. And she needs to smile more! They don’t literally have that last one, but god, they might as well.</p>

<p>This is one of those feminist episodes that…. fails in almost every way, but god, is it insulting. I mean, I guess it’s trying. Kind of. The original concept was to make it a kind of comical farce, like a Shakespearean farce, but the director, Bashir’s actor, and Quark’s actor decided to play this DEAD serious. As such, the writing and the visual intent clash in a way that is very, VERY uncomfortable.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/1Pgnw9l.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We literally get three straight minutes of this guy they invited chasing Quark around her room, trying to sexually assault her.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/cDnTSaX.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Brunt bursts it and is like “THAT’S NOT WOMAN, THAT’S A MAN, BABY” but when Quark shows her tits to this guy, he doesn’t care. Well at least he’s a chaser, I guess. Anyway alls well that ends well, and he backs Zek to put him back in office. Quark’s experience with being a woman makes him more sympathetic, at least for a bit, and he apologizes to the woman he sexually assaulted, and she’s like “oh but I was looking forward to fucking you :(“. Ha ha, what… fun.</p>

<p>Yeah, this blows a lot. To be fair, Armin Shimmerman, Quark’s actor, also agrees. He thinks the half-serious half-joke idea failed horribly, I agree, and he actually toned down some of it, because the script wanted him to cry a lot, and he felt it was a bad stereotype, and went against the feminist angle of the episode. Yea, that’s true. It could have been even worse. Also, Quark really learns nothing by the end, and yeah. THey LITERALLY go “You’ll be back to your old self soon~”</p>

<p>And obviously, this episode wasn’t built with trans stuff in mind, but as trans stuff is VERY in the public conscious these days, it’s hard to ignore that reading. And that voice outing scene made me want to gag. I hated this episode, but I can’t give it a 1. It’s at least TRYING to be good, it’s trying, but fucking god.</p>

<p><strong>Time’s Orphan</strong> - DS9
7/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/dVWHBeg.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>O’Brien is back! We haven’t seen him in a few episodes. And KEIKO IS BACK! We haven’t seen her in AGES! They’re back from Bajor, and O’Brien doesn’t want them to ever part again. The bad news is, they are immediately parted. O’BRIEN MUST SUFFER! They’re playing on a Bajoran colony on vacation, and Molly finds a weird gate thing in a cave and falls into it, disappearing as the gate closes.</p>

<p>They find out it’s a TIME PORTAL that was just sitting around I guess, and it sent her hundreds of years in the past. She’s now somewhere in the past, when the planet was uninhabited. They reactivate the portal, and get her back… but 10 years too late. She’s now 18, and is a wild child. She bites O’Brien before she’s sedated. She’s VERY unga bunga. Now they need to re-integrate her into society, and good luck with that,.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the B-plot is that Worf needs to baby sit Yoshi, and he is VERY bad with kids. At least the A and B plots fit. It’s also a fun concept.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/4fCwdwq.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The episode then becomes Keiko and O’Brien trying to rehabilitate Molly, who seems to have repressed all her childhood memories and remembers nothing. It’s actually REALLY heartwarming and sweet to watch, tinged, with some sadness.</p>

<p>Eventually she becomes a little unstable. She’s improving, but she wants to go “home”. They take her home, but no, not THAT home. HOME. They can’t go back to the planet though, so they take her to the holosuite. But they can’t keep her there forever, and when other customers want it, Molly goes…. feral, and freaks out, and then runs through the bar and STABS A MAN IN THE STOMACH WITH A BROKEN BOTTLE. Oh. Oh that’s very bad. The man presses charges and wants her incacerated, because she’s dangerous. I mean, she kind of is… it’s a very unfortunate situation. She needs wide open spaces, but they can’t really give her that on the station. And they’re going to send her to a therapy center, which is PROBABLY not going to be good for her either. And imagine her being on a transport for a few days.</p>

<p>So what are they going to do? Time for O’Brien to do crimes.</p>

<p>They kidnap Molly and drag her, sedated, back to the planet. She’s not safe there, she’s not really safe anywhere… so they try to steal a runabout, and are caught. Odo’s like “Come on Chief, I thought if ANYONE could steal a runabout without getting caught, it’d be you. On your way”.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/oABXZlr.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They send Molly back through the portal, planning to destroy it after. It’s a tearful goodbye, but Molly goes through, to his home… and then finds out she’s been transported not to her time, but to the exact time she went through the first time, finding herself as a 7 year old. She sends her back through, and fades away due to temporal shenanigans.</p>

<p>Well, that KINDA negates the gut punch. That’s a real shame. Like, I liked everything about this episode, it was cute and heartrending, and then it meant nothing! Hmmrf. Good, but didn’t hit the landing.</p>

<p><strong>The Sound of Her Voice</strong> - DS9
9/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/4HcpJvs.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>On the way home from a long tiring mission, the Defiant gets a distress call from a woman who’s apparently a star fleet officer asking for help. They head over to help her. They can’t get any messages back through the planet, and O’Brien is on the case. He leaves her SOS message on as she rambles, basically. She’s just rambling about her life, because she has no one to talk to and is scared she’s going to die. Everyone is like “why are you doing that”. And he’s like “I dunno, it just feels right, like someone HAS to listen, otherwise she’s falling on deaf ears, and that’s sad”</p>

<p>Also the B-plot is Quark is distracting Odo by reminding him of his love for Kira in order to do illegal stuff, and Jake is researching him. It doesn’t fit.</p>

<p>Anyways they connect and can communicate with her now. She’s a captain who was returning to the Alpha Quadrant after an 8 year exploration of the Beta Quadrant. She’s the only one in her squad left, and she’s dying on an L-Class planet, so they’d better get there fast, but they keep her company. Most of the crew find her boring as fuck. Especially Bashir. She tortures him for ignoring him by pretending that something got her and ate her. It wakes him up and makes him realize he was being shitty. She’s his patient.</p>

<p>It’s kinda interesting seeing this. Everyone talks to her in a different way. O’Brien practically uses her as a friend and therapist. She tries to give advise to Sisko. And she and Bashir jab at each other. But things take a bad turn; the medicine she’s using runs out faster than expected, as her last dose was tainted. She’ll die in two days of CO2 poisoning. And they’re still 3 days away.</p>

<p>The b-plot ends in a cute way. Quark gets outplayed by Odo, who hears Quark like “and after I helped him with with Kira, tsk tsk”, and Odo decides to… let him have one. JUST this one. It’s cute. Odo’s been pretty good these episodes, he’s really grown as a person.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/HvaIkGS.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Tried taking a picture and caught this picture instead that looks like Sisko just heard someone on the bridge make a racist joke</p>

<p>They have to risk their lives in a few ways to make it in time, but they do it, to save her life.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/lxajUtY.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Anyways they go, and find out she’s been dead for years. The anomaly that they had to get through caused her SOS to go forward in time. They couldn’t have EVER made it in time. She had no chance ):</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/sW6ycOK.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They couldn’t save her, but they have a funeral for her, because over those six days, she had become a friend. And not only that, but she taught them all that they needed to talk, that they were holding things inside. It’s really touching. A very good scene. And a good episode! The Quark B plot was alright but mostly unrelated and didn’t fit in, but it ended quite nicely.</p>

<p><strong>Tears of the Prophets</strong> - DS9
5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/L3PVskj.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Things are gonna be changing around here.</p>

<p>An admiral shows up to award Sisko an… award, and also tell him that he’s been chosen to plan the invasion of Cardassia! A big call. He only lost 70% of the fleet taking back DS9, so it’ll go better this time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Worf and Dax are thinking of having a baby! Quark and Bashir are being weird about it because they’re being weird incels cause Dax is hot. Look, yes, she’s hot, I want to date her too, but she shot you both down SEASONS ago, get over it. You’re already dating one of the hottest lizards in the quadrant, Bashir, stop being greedy.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/NAAU6y4.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Meanwhile, guess who’s back at Cardassia? That’s right, it’s Dukat! And he’s looking… a little off. His makeup feels more rough, less correct. I think it’s on purpose, especially when he’s side by side with Damar. He’s not doing so hot. No one on Cardassia, even Damar, really wants anything to do with him, but they ask him what he wants. And all he wants to do is give them the Alpha Quadrant… and all he needs is an artifact they took from Bajor and is still sitting on Cardassia, somewhere, probably</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/WZFyvjX.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Hey, our boy is back! Yes, he’s gonna be an actual fixture! He sings a serenade to “the losers”, AKA Quark and Bashir, and then tells them to fucking get over themselves, they never had a chance and this was over years ago. Namely, six fucking seasons ago. This also feels weirdly out of nowhere considering the rest of the episode is planning to invade Cardassia, but it WILL come together. For better or for worse.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/UUhRO5z.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Oh hey we found out what Dukat is looking for. “We’ve spent too long fighting the Bajorans. We should have fought their gods”. And then he released a Pah Wraith and accepts it inside him. Super Powered Dukat D:</p>

<p>While the invasion is going on, Dukat beams onto DS9, murders Dax in cold blood in a VERY brutal and upsetting scene, and then released the Pah Wraith into an Orb, basically breaking it apart. Dukat, then fully in control of his faculties, is like “I never intended to do you any harm, sorry~” then beams back away. The broken orb seems to have affected Sisko out in the battle, and he’s taken to his room while Kira takes control of the battle. They manage to win the battle and ground troops land on Cardassia. So I guess Dukat’s plan didn’t work? Uh no, bad news. The wormhole is gone.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/HvJezFe.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Dax is dying, and while Bashir saved the symbiont, Jadzia can’t be saved. She’s come down with an extremely terminal case of Rick Berman. While this might have been emotional if I watched it in the late 90s, I watch it in the mid 2020s with hindsight about WHY it happened, and I’ll be real, I fucking hate it. It also doesn’t help that this entire episode has been her being all happy and going “oh boy a baby oh gee I’m so happy I love my life I sure do love living and being alive”, like the death flags are ALL OVER HERE.</p>

<p>Everyone takes this poorly, ESPECIALLY Sisko, who is so shaken that he essentially quits, both as Emissary and as Captain. Everyone says they’ll be waiting for him when he gets back, and then he leaves with Jake. Kira thinks that he’s not coming back. Why? Cause he took the baseball with him.</p>

<p>So basically, Dax’s actor was like “So, since the show is ending next season, I want to look for more work. Can we re-negotiate my contract so I’m more of a recurring character and not a main character?” and Berman went “No, guess we’ll fire you and kill of your character”. And none of the writers or other co-producers knew this conversation at all, they just assumed that she was leaving cause she wanted off the show. And when they found out, they were PISSED. <strong>I’m</strong> pissed. Its the most Rick Berman thing in the entire series, and it’s AWFUL to me. What this means for the future of the show, we’ll see, but it already starts in a VERY gross part. And her death wasn’t even very good or exciting, like. She’s just one shot with no agency, and then is given a “there’s nothing we can do, they lost the will to live”. And this is AFTER the episode starts with two horny bachelors going “God I wish I could fuck Dax”. I hate this. A lot.</p>

<p>The rest of the episode is FINE? It’s a lot of religious stuff that’s okay, but it jumps around a lot. And it ends even worse. And that “I’ve failed as a starship captain” thing??? Like, what would have changed if you stayed home? Could YOU have stopped Ultra Instinct Super Saiyan God Dukat??? He one shot Jadzia with a Red Laser Beam that looked HORRIBLE to experience. At least now we have a foothold in Cardassia!!</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="DS9" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 73</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/15/OOCY73.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 73" /><published>2024-12-15T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-12-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/15/OOCY73</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/15/OOCY73.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/IYsIOpc.png" alt="&quot;Well, I guess it is kinda like we've been going out.

<p>Every Sunday my Twitch subs and I watch Star Trek in my Discord. Here are my reviews and thoughts on each of the episodes as I see it. If you’re curious about a nerd’s views on Star Trek episodes, please read on, I go quite in depth with some of these episodes! I’ve watched some Star Trek before but not all of it!</p>

<p><strong>Rise</strong> - VOY
6/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/W02qh83.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Voyager is helping some friendly aliens who’s planet is being harassed by a bunch of asteroids. They can’t blow them apart though, no matter what, the asteroids are reacting weirdly. If they can’t stop them, many might die. They get a call from a scientist from the surface who says the asteroids are “Not what they seem” before he’s cut off, so it’s time to visit him. On the way down, however, their shuttle crashes, which is the only thing I ever see these fucking shuttles do.</p>

<p>It’s now Neelix, Tuvok, an alien they brought with them, and the scientist and his friend who go and meet them at the crash site. They need to get back up to Voyager with the scientist, but how? The shuttle is fried. Luckily there’s an orbital tether nearby they can use to get up, though it’s damaged. Neelix offers to take control of the mission, basically, and takes responsibility for fixing the tether. He wants to prove to Neelix that he has what it takes to be on this team. They find a squatter who’s been hiding in the tether, who threatens Neelix with a knife, but he’s a pleasant guy so he convinces her to stand down and join them instead.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/RmVZTPA.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Meanwhile on Voyager, they determine that the asteroids have some kind of guidance system in them. Someone is TRYING to attack the planet.</p>

<p>Back in the tether, the scientist they picked up is being a dick. He tries to leave without them. He gets in a fight with others. One of them tries to throw him out of the thing, and Tuvok needs to stop him. So when he’s killed, seemingly by poison, there’s no immediate idea of who it could be. (Though it’s kinda obviously just from vibes) It’s a good setup and concept for a murder mystery… though the pacing, and as I said, vibes, are a biiit off. It’s not as good as it could be, I feel. The scientist gives a warning about something on the roof before dying, and Neelix decides that they have to go up to see what that is. Tuvok, being a condescending dickhead, disagrees, and Neelix RIPS into him in a scene I kinda love, about how yes, he has no feelings about Neelix, as he says, but that’s the problem. NO respect, at all, for the past three years.</p>

<p>Anyways Tuvok goes on the roof and gets thrown off by the traitor, who’s the guy they came down with, who was working with some aliens who are trying to genocide the planet and claim it for themselves. Neelix is injured, but manages to sneak Tuvok back into the shuttle, who beats the shit out of the traitor and throws him out in a HILARIOUS scene that looks like shit in a way I appreciate. He and Neelix have a heart to heart, and they make it back, using the scientist’s information to take out the aliens and save the day. Yay!</p>

<p>The actual episode part of the episode was just okay, though I did really like the Neelix and Tuvok parts</p>

<p><strong>Favorite Son</strong> - VOY
4/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/LfhWsO6.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>As they fly around space, Kim is having some deja vu moments… including a moment where they meet a new alien species, he goes “I REMEMBER THIS, THEY’RE GOING TO FIRE”, then reroutes weapons to ops and opens fire on the random aliens. Well that’s fucked. Belanna gets second degree burns on her lungs in the ensuing battle. That’s VERY fucked. Harry feels bad cause oopsies he did a warcrime and almost did murder ):</p>

<p>He then has nightmares about it, and about being sick with chicken pox, and then wakes up with a weird-ass rash. The doctor can’t find anything wrong with him, he’s just… turning red in parts of his body.\</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Txsd0r8.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>After some study, they find out yes, those aliens WERE about to shoot on them. So uh, turns out Harry’s hunches are a GOOD thing, in a way? Especially as they’re now being chased by more aliens. Harry leads them to a star system, where they are saved by people calling themselves Taresian, who explain that Harry is a Taresian, who’s finally made it back home.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/lYhrmFs.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The Taresians are almost all sexy women who are rubbing all over Harry, and it grosses me out. Thats intentional, for the record. The purpose of this episode was, quote, “a male fantasy piece with a dark twist”. Well, we’ll see the dark twist eventually. The Taresians explain that they go around to other planets and impregnate women with their babies, which is fucked beyond belief, and then those babies will try to find their way back to Taresian space. Hey cool, can you help get us back to Earth then??????? No? Okay.</p>

<p>The vibes here are rancid. They’ve got a lot of weird rituals that are… off, and they seem to be isolating Voyager from Kim. But it’s fine cause he’s about to be married to a bunch of hot women, that’s GREAT! Voyager finds out they implanted a virus that’s turning him into a Taresian. But for what reason? :o</p>

<p>This episode keeps trying to be sexy, but Kim has this permanent virginity energy about him that makes it uncomfortable, nad not in the way they’re TRYING to make it uncomfortable. He always has the energy that he’s trying to get away from these hot babes and get to the nearest D&amp;D table.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/z0J6siN.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Harry looks for the only other dude who has were, and find him, a dried husk. Oh my god they <strong>SUCKED HIM DRY</strong>. Yeah, they turn aliens into them, lead them there with implanted genetic memories, and then eat their genetic code. Voyager rescues him, and they leave. Eh.</p>

<p><strong>Before and After</strong> - VOY
8/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/ckwWkCq.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Fascinating cold open here. We see the Doctor, with hair, operating on people worried about their family member. He then tells the person that they were “the best friend they ever had”, and then used a “temporal bio-chanber” something or other on her, and then she wakes up and a boy is like “hello, Grandma Kes”. Ooh, some intrigue!</p>

<p>Kes is apparently 9 years old, so this is six years in the future. We see some interesting things, I always love seeing what Trek assumes it could be like in an alternate future. Kes has a kid with Paris, and their kid has another kid with… Kim. Kim, the fuck you doin’??? Janeway appears to be gone, and we’ve got Captain Choky, as we’re calling him. Kes appears to have no memories of anything, except for that first scene, and then she gets cold and wakes up in her room.</p>

<p>It appears to be that she’s living life in reverse. Everyone is thinking she might be delusional, but eventually she knows something she SHOULDN’T know, after going back in time again, so they’re like “okay, sOMETHING is up”</p>

<p>Apparently, B’Ellana and Janeway died in <strong>“THE YEAR OF HELL”</strong>. I’m sure that won’t be important. Paris rebounded with Kes, apparently.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/sl5MSvl.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The aliens they fought during <strong>THE YEAR OF HELL</strong> used temporal weapons, and they has caused chroniton radiation. And this, alongside the bio temporal chamber thingy are causing her to live life backwards, her first memories from her death. And eventually she might just… go back to her birth, or even before.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/V8xEZlW.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We have to watch Kes give birth. Whoof. This is DURING the <strong>YEAR OF HELL</strong>, and then we go back even further, to just the start of the <strong>YAR OF HELL</strong>. Okay I’m getting tired of writing it like that. It’s the <strong>YELL</strong> now. So at the start of <strong>YELL</strong>, Kes gets to meet Torres, who’s in a relationship with Paris, and then we watch her and Janeway die. Dammit. Kes is trying to use her future knowledge to help people, now not caring as much about fixing her problem, and worrying more about helping others. After she finds out she’s infected, though, she goes and finds out what the torpedo’s… variance was, so she can stop her backwards movement. She goes back one more time, 11 years before <strong>YELL</strong>, and they uh… throw some anti-chronitons at her. Did you know there’s <em>anti-time</em>??</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/rm9BxTF.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>It does work. She goes back to the start of Voyager, then to her childhood. This is horrifying. Her parent, or whoever it is, is kinda like “ohhh you’ve been on a starship, of course you have!” and she has NO way of fixing this issue. She goes back to being born… Then to being an embryo… then egg cells, and finally nothing. It’s black.</p>

<p>They maybe should have just stopped there, that would have been fucking NUTS, but no, now time is moving forward normally. She’s brought back, the anti-chronitons worked perfectly! She’s now back as a healthy 3 year and two month old. Kes now has all her memories, AND the future memories. And she’s keeping a lot of those secret… but she will warn them on the Krenim. I’m sure that won’t be important.</p>

<p>I actually really liked this episode. Really fun concept, done well, rather horrifying in a way</p>

<p><strong>Real Life</strong> - VOY
9/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/KBdd0QU.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We start with a Jetsons-ass 50s-ass family ready to see their husband/father off to work, as the Doctor comes back, and then transfers to Sickbay. Turns out he made a new Holodeck family, to see what its like to have a family. It’s kinda like something Data would do. In fact, he DID kinda do that once, though uh, hopefully this time it will end without me sobbing into my tea. He invited his friends over to meet his family, sounds cute.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, they are exploring space and find that some aliens blew up a scientific space station, and they need to find out who did it. These two concepts aren’t going to mesh well are they?</p>

<p>The holo-family keeps talking about how great the doctor is, and how he’s the best person and best doctor in the whoooole wide world. Torres, who has had a very, VERY not good family life, is EXTREMELY offended. This COULD be interesting! A plot that tries to show that the perfect neuclear family we are TAUGHT is the goal isn’t true or real, showsn through Torres’ fucked up familial history, sounds almost more MODERN than something from the 90s. I’m worried they’ll fuck it up though.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/qBWZ9bq.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Torres “fixes” the problem by apparently adding randomness. Now one of the children is a brat who is very very needy, the mom is exhausted and belligerent, and the son is trans-Klingon. Torres programmed his life into a wacky sitcom. TOTALLY on purpose, too.</p>

<p>There’s a scene where Torres and Paris flirt with each other. I… WEIRDLY don’t hate it. So there’s a thing this episode is doing. Torres is kinda… a character. Not just an angry woman who does her job. She’s snarking back, reasonably annoyed but putting her frustrations to positive things…. she’s reading porn. In the mess hall.</p>

<p>“Doc, you’re acting like you’re trying to cure a disease. You can’t… CURE a family” - Paris. That line is…. very good.</p>

<p>“Dad! what are you doing here???” “I live here, Jeffery, in case you’ve forgotten.” That line is. Also good.</p>

<p>Jeffery gets in with some Bad Boys (Klingons), and we see a knife they call their dak’tag. I was like “that’s no Dak’tag. I’m guessing they fucked up?” Nope. It’s a Kut’luch knife, used in ritual violence to hurt someone innocent to become a warrior. That’s a… very dumb ritual. Why would they do that and then call it honorable? Anyways, it’s a good twist for Trek Nerds like me to go “WAIT NO.” Also, the Doctor’s daughter is injured playing Parese Squares and is probably going to die. Remember that sentence I said earlier about hopefully this won’t end with me crying in my tea? That might be ironic. The Ensign ends the problem, because holy SHIT, he cannot handle this.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Ar0BBxs.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>Amazing scene with Paris and the Doctor. You can’t have the good times and ignore and throw away the bad. The good things that can grow from adversity. The whole point of having a family is being there for each other.</p>

<p>Yep. I teared up. It’s pretty fucking harsh. And we watch this girl die, on screen. Fuck you, me. Fuck you and your ironic joke about crying. WHY DO WE EVEN HAVE PARESE SQUARES? THAT SHIT SHOULD BE OUTLAWED.</p>

<p>This episode’s A plot was basically perfect and hit very, VERY hard. The B-plot was uninteresting and barely there. It really holds the episode back.</p>

<p><strong>Distant Origin</strong> - VOY
9.5/10</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/nXtBN9q.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>We’ve got two scientists, Voth, a reptilian race. We’ve got Veer, and Gegen, who find a Voyager crewman who died a season ago, and determine that his DNA is actually shockingly similar to their’s, which supports Gegen’s theory: The Voth did not evolve here, but are from the Alpha Quadrant. Now they need to hunt down this ship and find out what they can about these people. When they go to get funding, however, the People In Charge are bothered, because this could upset the balance (namely, the fact that they claim they are the most superior people here, and disrupt their power, y’know how it is). They charge Gegen, so Gegen and Veer go to chase after this dead person’s vessel. They have a thing in his tech that says they’re chasing after something called… Voyager.</p>

<p>This is a VERY good and interesting setup.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/IANmL5L.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>They make it to Voyager, and sneak on board, cloaking to examing. It’s basically two nerds walking around and making biological commentary about humans. They’re not harmful or evil at all, just weird. And then they’re discovered. The Federation, understandably, think they might be dangerous. And they run away like “maaaybe we should explain outselves”, but when they’re shot at, and the younger one, Veer, shoots back, stunning Chakotay. Gegen kidnaps Chakotay, while Veer goes into hibernation out of fear.</p>

<p>Chakotay and Gegen kinda bond, because Gegen is a pleasant dude who just wants to learn about Humans, and Chakotay is white bread who can’t stay mad even when he’s kidnapped. Voyager discovers the connection between their species, that the Voth evolve from Dinosaurs… and then a Voth ship shows up. It’s huge. Like, HUGE. VERY, VERY BIG. Thousands of times bigger than Voyager. Voyager is literally beamed inside of the ship, and then the Voth invade, and COMPLETELY obliterates them. They can’t do SHIT.</p>

<p>Now Gegen gets a message. They have Voyager and will kill everyone if he doesn’t come to stand trial for heresy.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/qvtCi9Q.png" alt="trek" /></p>

<p>The last part of the episode is a trail. Gegen is on trial in a kangaroo court, Veer denounces him publicly, probably cause he was threatened. Gegen and Chakotay defend themselves, and science, against conservative ignorance. It’s very well written, though regretably it IS held back by Chakotay reading his lines with all the temerity of a guy reading the TV Guide out loud. The bigoted, conservative minister is going to lock EVERYONE in a detention colony unless Gegen publicly denounces his scientific claims. It’s PAINFUL watching him denounce it.</p>

<p>Gegen hopes that someday the truth comes out, but he wasn’t strong enough to stand up to the powers that be. Chakotay gives him a globe of Earth. He hopes, one day, he can see it, eyes open.</p>

<p>This episode was FANTASTIC. Almost perfect. I wish Chakotay and Janeway’s roles had been reversed, but like, it’s so well written in every other way.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="LizstarTrek" /><category term="Star Trek" /><category term="Voyager" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 72</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/13/OOCY72.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 72" /><published>2024-12-13T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-12-13T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/13/OOCY72</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/13/OOCY72.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/Eo171q9.png" alt="&quot;So basicaly..... it's trauma.&quot;" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Some PC88 sets came out so I played a few of them. The first is Magnet Girl by Lotus Roots, a doujin game! I think I’ve explained doujin games before, but they’re basically the same as doujin manga. Just uh, games. Doujin is usually used to refer to like, fanworks of things in America, but it basically means self published works. Nerds would make games on PCs of the day, namely NEC’s PC88, and would sell copies of it at local stores and conventions. They were pretty much as indie as you possibly could have gotten back in the 80s.</p>

<p>Though this game is 90s. This lasted for a while, well into the modern day. The most famous doujin game is, in fact, Touhou. All the early Touhous were PC98 games released as doujin games! But I digress, let’s talk about Magnet Girl.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/OrMSEr8.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Lotus Roots made a few of these “Magnet World” games, but I’ve only played this one so far. It’s a rather short puzzle game with a unique mechanic. You platform around, pretty much on a grid, and you can swap your polarity from red to blue. There are magnets about, and they need to be pushed onto the opposite color, so they’re annihilated. Once all magnets are clear, you win. You push magnets by using your polarity. Like repels, opposites attracts. Turn on the same color to push a magnet around. You can’t pull, however, so turn on opposites instead to climb on top of magnets and use them to platform around and position yourself better. You can also repel yourself while on top of a magnet to reach greater heights!</p>

<p>It’s a little janky and a little clunky, but it’s a cute and clever concept. It’s got Sokoban energy, though I’ve never seen something quiiiite like this before. The game is not very long, and not super hard, but it’s a nice brain tickler, and I’d have loved to pick this up for 600 yen back in 1991.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="PC88" /><category term="retro games" /><category term="Obscure Games" /><category term="Magnet Girl" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 71</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/11/OOCY71.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 71" /><published>2024-12-11T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-12-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/11/OOCY71</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/11/OOCY71.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/eZcpZ4s.png" alt="&quot;&quot;How many times do I have to tell you I'm the dirtier one?!&quot; &quot;B-but I'm constantly thinking about @!$#ing you and stuff!&quot; &quot;S-so?

<p>Keeping with the Final Fantasy energy lately, I did The Final Fantasy Legend! Well, it KINDA fits, at least. The Final Fantasy Legend was known in Japan was Makai Toushi Sa・Ga, and is the first game in the SaGa series, which is its own distintive series that is not actually connected to Final Fantasy at all, except that a lot of the ideas in it are built off of Final Fantasy 2. But when it was translated for Western audiences, RPGs didn’t sell super well, so to try and boost sales, they connected it to Final Fantasy. This was a thing Square did a lot. Final Fantasy was at least KNOWN to some people here, so let’s just make this game a FF game even though it has little to do with it. At least this has more to do with Final Fantasy than Mystic Quest does.</p>

<p>This game is the first ever RPG for the Gameboy, released December 1989. As such, it’s pretty simple, but honestly it’s shockingly complex for that era, and for the Gameboy. Compare this to like… Mario Land. This shit looks like it at LEAST came out a few years later, if you compare them. The plot is simple: There’s a tower, and it’s said that the top of the tower holds a paradise. This tower connects many different worlds, and your characters are just one of countless adventurers who are tackling the tower. Simple, and actually quite commonly spoofed these days, ESPECIALLY the ending, which I WILL spoil, you’ve been warned.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/4HqUZFq.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>Like in Final Fantasy, you build your units out of different classes. There are three classes, and also two of which can be gendered, which is neat. You’ve got humans, mutants/espers, and monsters. Yes, monsters in this game can be friendly, and even fight alongside you! Humans don’t level up traditionally, instead they level up by using stat up items you can only buy in town. Mutants level up by fighting, getting random stat ups as they fight. And monsters level up by eating other monsters. As monsters are defeated, they can drop meat, which can be eaten to transform your monster. It’s fascinating. The humans are totally the best, though, if you’re okay with a bit of grinding.</p>

<p>The game is split into a few chapters, basically. You have the Continent World, then after you do all the stuff there and get The Orb that unlocks the tower, you climb 1/4th of the tower to reach the next world. Do the quests there, get the next orb, climb five floors, get to the next level. Repeat until you get all four orbs and reach the top to fight ASHURA. After defeating her, you need to climb the tower, AGAIN, and find God at the top, who’s like “Yeah this is just a game. You’re just my toys, I wanted to see if y’all could defeat real evil”, and your characters, disgusted at this behavior, KILL GOD. It’s sick as fuck.</p>

<p>The story is simple, but the little stories you encounter in the different worlds can get really interesting. They’re pretty impressive for a 1989 gameboy RPG! I recommend the game almost for these stories alone, but the gameplay is fun too.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgur.com/TsJUNc7.png" alt="Game" class="center-block" /></p>

<p>I had to play the game as a solo run, actually. Which SOUNDS hard but like, it’s not, at all. If you pick Human Female, you get a really good item, which you immediately sell for a money boost, spending it on power ups to be able to handle the early areas easier. And the first floor’s whole thing if you’re collecting King Equipment, which makes you essentially invincible. You then just farm. I farmed for about 40 minutes before getting enough money to get my stats up to 140-ish each, and I was good. I just cruised through the game, occasionally upgrading my stats further. Your stats can go to 255 before overflowing back to zero, but it only shows to 99, which CAN be annoying.</p>

<p>Anyways, this is a really good game that I’d have loved back in the day. I can see why it’s beloved, and I’m glad I finally got to it!</p>

<p>Also one more fun thing, from Wikipedia: “Square’s concept for the game was a title that could be completed in six to eight hours, based on the duration of an airplane flight between Narita, Japan and Honolulu, Hawaii.” Thats cute.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lizstar</name></author><category term="RAMastery" /><category term="Retro Achievements" /><category term="Gameboy" /><category term="retro games" /><category term="Final Fantasy" /><category term="SaGa" /><category term="Reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Out of Context Yuri 69 - NSFW</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/09/OOCY69.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Out of Context Yuri 69 - NSFW" /><published>2024-12-09T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-12-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/09/OOCY69</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/oocy/2024/12/09/OOCY69.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://imgur.com/jww0sT1.png" alt="&quot;Hey, you can still keep going, right?
